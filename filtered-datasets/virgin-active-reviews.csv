Started trial pass this week and attended my first reformer Pilates class. Fran was really detailed and patient. She took time to explain the basics of the equipment and moves. Enjoyed it and will be back again!,5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,211,2024
Zaidi is always very friendly with a warm welcoming smile. He's also very nice to help me check an email sending from virgin active regarding to membership and then he advised me what could I do next.,5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,200,2024

"Working with Khai has genuinely transformed my life and fitness journey! When I started, my body fat percentage was at a discouraging high. With Khais expert guidance, Ive seen a remarkable shift. Ive dropped from 26% body fat to 21% and my weight has decreased by 5kg in 3 months!

Khais tailored approach has improved my shoulder mobility and knee health dramatically. I no longer worry about knee pain, thanks to the simple yet effective rehab exercises Khai designed for me. His strength training regimen has also taken me to new heights. Ive hit personal records that I never thought was possible.

One of the most rewarding aspects has been fitting into clothes I thought Id never wear again, including my work uniform. Its an incredible feeling to see such tangible results and feel more confident every day.

Throughout our sessions, Khais been supportive, motivating, and incredibly knowledgeable. He makes every workout session enjoyable and challenging. If youre looking for someone who truly cares about your progress and will push you to be your best, I cant recommend Khai enough.

Thank you, Khai, for everything youve helped me achieve!",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,1152,2024

"Dealt with Justine. Insincere and incompetent. A gym membership is such a basic product but she can OFFER
something and FAIL to deliver. And I'm not even sure if she realises what happens. Thus I rather warn others who are joining rather than sort this out with the gym, absolute waste of my time",1,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,296,2024
"As someone who didnt always like going to the gym, I now enjoy going to the gym so much more, and a lot of it is because of Khai, who is a very helpful PT, as he looks out for my well-being and goals, and is encouraging and pushes my ability. I can safely say my shoulder mobility has improved, and that Ive gained a lot more strength after being in his care as well. He also gives templates of workouts to do when we dont have sessions, which is super helpful when I want to do my own workouts. Very thankful for his guidance in my fitness journey too!",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,553,2024
"The facilities at Virgin Active are amazing. I love the diversity of the classes and the equipment. The customer service is excellent as well, and I'd like to give a special shout-out to Muhammad who was very helpful.",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,217,2024

"Beyond the training, the friendly staff at PLQ Virgin Active always make me feel welcome, and the club's facilities and amenities are top-notch. The gym is consistently clean and comfortable, creating an ideal environment for staying motivated and focused.

When I entered my 50s, I realized how crucial it was to stay fit and healthy. In 2019, I joined PLQ Virgin Active and started training with Avan as my personal trainer. From day one, he has been incredibly professional, customizing every exercise movements to align with my goals, focusing on full-body mobility, strength and muscle mass building. Avan's patience and support got me started and made me enjoy every workout session. Today, I'm proud of the progress I've made - my increased strength and transformed muscle definition are a testament to Avan's dedication. I couldn't have achieved these results without him!",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,880,2024
Called multiple times since yesterday - still nobody picks up the phone. Is no one working or is the number just for show...?,1,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,125,2024
"Working with Coach Avan has been a game-changer for my fitness journey, especially during recovery and post-op rehabilitation.

The gym itself is always spotless, creating a comfortable and motivating environment. The staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming, making each visit a positive experience. Highly recommend Avan and this branch of VA.",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,547,2024

I really love the gym. Paya Lebar branch by far the best when it comes to the machines and also the team working there. I'm glad that we had Olga helping us throughout the entire journey of our membership for the past 2+ years. She's the kindest and most responsive by far! It's a pity that we have to move areas but I really hope that one day VA comes to the North East :)),5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,374,2024
"I've had a great experience at Virgin Active Paya Lebar, especially with the well-maintained facilities and the wide range of classes. KC has been very helpful with my membership needs, and Hai Ngee's training has been instrumental in my fitness progress. Overall, I'm very satisfied and appreciate the supportive environment.",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,326,2024
"I recently had the pleasure of visiting Virgin Active Paya Lebar, where I was expertly assisted by KC. From the moment I arrived, KC provided exceptional service, arranging a spin trial and giving me a detailed tour of the state-of-the-art facilities. Her approach was both professional and thoughtful--she made me feel welcomed and at ease without exerting any undue pressure to commit, which significantly enhanced my overall experience.

KC's ability to balance professionalism with a genuine, personable demeanor left a lasting positive impression on me and on the Virgin Active brand. Her commitment to understanding my needs and ensuring I was comfortable throughout the process was exemplary. Although I am currently bound by an existing gym membership, KC's excellent service has made me eager to transition to Virgin Active as soon as possible. I greatly appreciate her efforts and look forward to becoming a member of this impressive facility.

Please look for KC if you want to signup, she's really good",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,1014,2024

"I've been a member at the PLQ branch for a while now, and even though it's smaller compared to some other locations, the experience is exceptional. The staff are consistently friendly and always go the extra mile to ensure you're well taken care of. A special shoutout to Joana, who has been outstanding since day one. Her warm personality and dedication to addressing members' needs have truly made the customer journey remarkable.",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,432,2024
"Wonderful gym with clean equipment, friendly staff and members, and a whole diversity of classes! Sufficient machines for the average gym goer. Great views during cardio too.

Well-stocked and well-maintained changing room with high quality shampoo, conditioner, body soap, and lotion. Mirrors are well-lit too. Lockers are all quite clean so far.

Edit to add: Your staff Maya has been immensely helpful with top-notch customer service - she assisted to store my bulky parcel (meant for delivery which failed) for an evening I had to go into town, and even waited until closing for me to come back. Really appreciate her going the extra mile. You know that at Virgin Active you are paying for not just quality equipment and training slace, but also quality service.

I hope VA will continue to have such a great standard of service!",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,323,2024

"Overall the studio needs to be upkeep better especially the pantry and washroom. Cups are super dirty, when I use a tissue to wipe, its brown on the inside. One of the even had mould on it because the cup was all the way hidden inside and probably not used for a long time. Toilet rolls are often used up. I dont see the studio being under staff. There are plenty of staff in fact but the studio is not at its best condition compared to the rest of the outlets in town.",2,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,469,2024
I have had Ken as a pt for a few years now and he is the best. After a severe injury he's helped me get back into action within no time. He's specialised in rehab training and that shows both in a well thought out exercise plan and help with the release of muscle tension. Highly recommended!,5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,292,2024
"Been a Virgin Active member for more than 2 years and I am sorry to say customer service at this outlet have been slipping lately. Had booked a class today at 10.45pm today but have forgotten to bring my wallet and thus my virgin active card.

I understand fully the company policy that card has to be brought for check-in but was hoping that I can use my Virgin Active app to indicate my Virgin Active membership and the class booking.

However, I am shocked to be met by hostile customer service from a male staff who seems pissed that I didnt bring my card and used an aggressive tone with me. I am alright with the message yes I should always bring my card but the tone used here is horrible. I explained kindly that this is a one-off instance and he just replied curtly asking what attire I need. I replied my sizing and requested a locker as well and he replied in a dismissive tone for a locker I will need to provide a card as a deposit. I explained once again that I have left my wallet at home and this is not able to provide my card. But l do have a confirmed class booking and cant the staff use my details (e.g writing on a note my membership ID and using that as a deposit ) if they are that concerned about me stealing a locker key?

I will not be stating the above if Virgin Active does not command a premium price for its gym membership. Virgin Active state that their mission is to bring positive change to peoples lives, because lifes more fun when you move. But I am feeling nothing but negativity from the customer service interaction today.",1,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,1562,2024

"Horrible and rude pilates teacher in Paya Lebar , reformer can only be used after classes . The reformer was taken out after i sign for package . I wonder is a reformer not consider exercise machine . Why must everyone joined classes . And once when I arrive earlier to use the instructor treat it like their house chiding people for using in when they want to use .",1,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,366,2024
"I had a positive experience attending personal training sessions with Khairul. He is very friendly and approachable which is important in a gym environment. The sessions were well structured and informative, and Khairul went above and beyond by giving advice about meals and macros. He makes a great edition to the team at Paya Lebar ",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,334,2024
The most happening and friendly crew. Always feel very welcomed altho I don't bring my card at times. They always serve me with a smile. Never regretted joining. Thank You Team PLQ. To many more years ;),5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,203,2024

"I'm really loving being a member of this gym - everyone is so friendly and helpful. The classes are great - my particular favourite being Pilates and all the instructors are excellent. My only 'gripe' is people getting changed into their gym clothes / normal clothes in the toilets... meaning those who actually need the toilet can be left waiting in long queues at busy times.

Equipment is new, well maintained and cleaned. Support staff do a great job in this respect keeping everything clean and orderly.",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,508,2024

"I would like to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for the exceptional personal training experience provided by Mr. Yeo Hai Ngee. Throughout our sessions, Hai Ngee demonstrated an unparalleled level of dedication and professionalism that truly sets him apart. Having worked with three other personal trainers from different gyms in the past, I can confidently say that Hai Ngee surpasses them all.

His commitment to helping me achieve my fitness goals was evident in every session. He consistently went above and beyond, checking in on my dietary habits and ensuring I remained accountable to my fitness regimen. His unwavering support and encouragement were instrumental, especially during challenging moments when my progress seemed to plateau.

One aspect of his dedication that truly impressed me was he never missed a single training session and has complete focus during our sessions. This level of professionalism speaks volumes about his commitment to his role.

Thanks to Hai Ngees expertise and guidance, I was able to achieve remarkable results, losing over 10kg and experiencing a transformative change in my life. I am incredibly grateful for his dedication and would wholeheartedly recommend his services to anyone seeking a personalized and effective approach to fitness training! Hai Ngee is truly a gem to Virgin Active!",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,1349,2024
"Frans reformer class fantastically creative and exciting, almost each week has new movement",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,91,2024
The gym is small and the class space takes up 50% of the area. There are constantly classes going on with instructors shouting on microphones over the gym speakers. My head phones are on full volume and I can still hear them. They also just did multi month long renovations with very few improvements. They kept 30% of the spaces open during renovations and didnt compensate their members. Would not recommend this location. The other locations around SG are superior.,1,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,468,2024
"This is a very popular outlet when it comes to weekend classes so I always have to camp at 9pm to book. Unfortunately my fingers were too fast, I went to book next day 3 classes in a row without realising that it should be another Sunday. Wrote them an email at 9.40pm hoping they won't penalize me for the mistake since I have already planned birthday celebrations. The next day morning, Salim promptly replied and waived off the 3 strikes I gotten for cancelling classes. Really made my day! Thank you so much for been understanding too! So glad I have this outlet so near my house:)",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,585,2024
"I personally like VA Gyms, not only the staff are friendly, helpful and accommodating (special shout out to my consultant KC!), the gym is clean, bright and doesn't smell much compared to other gyms around Paya Lebar. The members are disciplined and considerate too. You can have free trial if you like, then commit only if you really like the gym. 

If you decided to go for free trial, you may use my code. If you decide to sign in, they have free 8weeks when you sign in with a buddy.

"Been going here for the last 1 year and I think theyre one of the best commercial gyms going around (not including the personal training gyms). The equipments and studios are top notch, booking system is simple and sensible, and counter staff and personal trainers are all really kind and helpful. I once dropped my Airpods into the laundry together with my workout shorts and it went all the way to the outsourced laundry company, and the counter staff, especially Salim, were kind enough to coordinate its recovery over 2 days, and kept me posted all along.",4,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,559,2024
"Super clean and well-equipped gym. Most importantly, staff are welcoming and kind!
I am so grateful to all of you who were at the club at 1.30pm on Jan 30 for pitching in a hand (literally) to the daunting task of finding my wedding ring amidst a mountain of laundry. You have no idea how touched I am - you did this enthusiastically, without complaint or expectation of reward.

It had been a tough month following a tough 2023 and this was the nicest gesture Ive received. I hope the VA management will appreciate you as well on my behalf!",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,541,2024
"Was a member of VA when they opened the first outlet in Raffles, and now I'm back in VA again. Always enjoy the vibe, classes and facilities of the club.

Enjoyed her reformer classes, the pace and intensity of each class is well managed and I always feel my muscles working after each class.",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,447,2024

"I left my waterbottle at VA Paya Lebar on 17 Dec 2023 and called 6 times before someone finally picked up the phone. I was able to speak to KC (Casey? Kacy?) who said they found my water bottle and would keep it for me so i could collect it in the month of Jan 24. I went back last week and they were unable to find it and said i needed to talk to KC directly. I went back today and asked for KC twice however she refused to come out and meet me and the counter staff were still unable to find my bottle. I am truly disappointed with my experience at VA Paya lebar. The zumba stage is always slippery after body pump because the it is not cleaned prior to class and our instructors have nearly slipped many times, there was once i even helped reset the room for the next class, the counter staff does not greet visitors when they reach the gym unlike other VA outlets and the staff being unwilling to come out and meet me or and/or apologize for the loss of the waterbottle is not befitting the status of a premium gym. However i would like to thank the new counter staff from Duo Galleria who tried to assist me last week and were kind and courteous. I really hope VA Paya Lebar can do better.",2,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,1194,2024
"Unlike the other reviewers here, I personally think there is no other gym in Singapore that can be compared to Virgin Active's great service and clean equipment.

Sure the PLQ joint is smaller. So obviously they can't have all the machines similar to those at the Raffles Place one right?! Manage your expectations instead of complaining this and that all the time.

It's my go to gym when I work from home and also during the weekends.

I can't comment on the lessons as I've never joined any. However, you have to understand they have to cater the lessons to a broad range of customers. This is not your personal gym, it's a gym for the masses.",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,646,2024

"Im a physician in corporate practice. I do attend cycle/RPM regularly at PLQ. Just to reiterate some of the concerns members have expressed re: lack of air conditioning. I think the management at this branch needs to get their act together. Lack of air conditioning or poor air condition / ventilation in an enclosed space with a full class of sweating cycling members for any duration is suffocating. It is also disaster waiting to happen re: high risks of heat exhaustion; and/or heat stroke, in the worst case. Triggers of lack of ventilation, poor body cooling in addition can trigger cardiac rhythm abnormalities that in the worst case, has risks of mortality. There is no ambulance on standby at the gym where emergencies like this (God forbid) should and can be avoided. Please do the right thing. Thank you!",1,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,815,2023
"I am writing to express my concerns about the recent experience I had during a cycling class at Virgin Active PLQ. The air conditioning in the cycle room was not functioning properly, causing the room to become uncomfortably warm, stuffy, and suffocating. This made it difficult to exercise and raised health concerns.

This is not the first time it happens, the aircon will auto shut down about 10 to 15 mins into the class. Have feedback to the front desk a few times but apparently nothing is done.

I kindly request that you address this issue promptly to ensure the comfort and safety of all members. I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a resolution.",1,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,682,2023
"We appreciate VAs commitment to environmental conservation by turning off the air conditioning when classes are still in session. However, I want to address this concern.

As paying members, I understand the importance of environmental responsibility, but this can be challenging when the room gets excessively humid during a cycling session with 25 participants. High humidity levels may lead to discomfort and potentially health concerns. I do seek your understanding from this perspective.

While we fully support the efforts to save the Earth, its essential to strike a balance to ensure the well-being of members too. Compromising on comfort to an extreme extent might not reflect positively on your branding. I hope for a solution that aligns with our environmental goals while ensuring the safety and comfort of members during classes.

Love the classes at VA especially Lynnes yoga align class on Wednesdays! I have been going to VA from January this year and honestly Im quite surprised that no 2 classes from Lynne are the same.

"Ive been a dedicated member of Virgin Active for some time now, and I cant say enough about the fantastic yoga and reformer classes they offer.

In particular, Ive had the pleasure of attending classes with Georgia and Hayley, who are phenomenal instructors. Not only are they experts in their craft, but they bring a positive energy to each class thats truly invigorating. Their willingness to listen to feedback and consistently provide varied and creative sequences is commendable.

What impresses me most is the effort and thought they put into planning and curating each class. Attending back-to-back classes or multiple times a week is a delight, as they always introduce fresh sequences while staying true to the weeks theme.

Beyond their expertise, what truly sets Georgia and Hayley apart is their patience and approachability. They take the time to connect with members on a personal level, creating a welcoming and inclusive environment in every class.",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,964,2023
"It could be crowded, expensive and sometimes the lift doesn't work(which would be very frustrating especially on leg days) but then you have the best personal trainers who become family. Terence, the pocket rocket, is one of the best trainers who goes the extra mile to squeeze you out of your humanly pleasures by making you do additional sets at end of the session.

"Experience, friendly and patience Instructors!

I would like to compliment Jeslin and Lynne for their super great Yoga Flow and Align classes! Their passion for yoga is evident, and their teaching style is both supportive and inspiring. They create a warm and welcoming atmosphere that encourages personal growth and exploration on the mat.

Like the energy and positive vibes they bring to class each time (as we feel it in during the practice), and they bring great sequences too! A sequence consist of breakdown poses (to strengthen and lengthen), leading up to getting advanced poses seamlessly! There are very attentive to their class attendance such they always accessible or stronger poses for everyone; be it for Beginners to Advanced Practioners! Strong practice which might get Beginners intimidated but it is a great practice to attend to consistently - You just get stronger day-by-day! They give clear cues to enter and exit to poses - which is important to prevent injuries.

And their calm class is superrrr good. It brings back ones inner peace and focus after a long day! Thanks Jeslin and Lynne for being amazing always!

Yoga and Reformer studios is small and cosy. Gym floor is spacious with variety of equipments to work with. Like the convenient location (which is near train station and malls!), making it easy to fit workouts into a busy schedule.

To sum up, Virgin Active is still the best with a variety of classes! I always leave feeling energized and accomplished.",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,1493,2023

Special shout out to Rozanne Y. for being so motivating and making Reformer Pilates classes so interesting & satisfying. And also special shout out to Jeslin L. for Yoga classes that not only help me physically relax but also spiritually calm. My PT classes with Avan had really helped me transform and strengthen my body and also inspired me to want to keep becoming better.",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,485,2023
"The first gym Ive signed and wont go anywhere else! I had a goal in mind to effectively learn how to do weight training myself and glad that after close to 5 months of PT session with no other than Terence who is an ultimate powerhouse I can now successfully say that I can smash a full week of workout myself!!

Truly learnt so much here, from hating weights to learning to counter my fears, dispel my beliefs and truly learn from the best. If theres anyone you can bump in the gym it will also be Terence who puts his 110% into every single session *rain or shine Im serious*!! His dedication to fitness and training is truly admirable and motivating.

If youve ever been to his grid classes (which are always fully booked) every Fridays and Saturdays, he is also full of energy always staying upbeat and positive while still correcting your form and pushing you. Theres no slacking when he is around!!! :P Big shout out to Terence the champ, thanks for the wonderful energy and vibes day in day out, its truly contagious!! =) 10/10",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,1034,2023

"I have been training at the Virgin Active Paya Lebar outlet for about 4 months now, and have also taken up personal training with Roy Ho. I must say it has been one of the best wellness decisions Ive made in a long time.

I decided to take up PT because I was seriously getting out of shape and yet had no idea how to begin at the gym. I had a previous lower back injury and also play football once a week - I wanted the gym training to accommodate to this whilst also being able to get the most out of it. The training program that Roy has planned for me has been very effective, and he is always making minor adjustments to ensure that the intensity and gains for each session are optimal. He is very knowledgeable and just about knows every kind of exercise or movement - which is very beneficial as he can still find an exercise to work a muscle even when it no longer has strength or is very pumped. He also doesnt try to push you to do or sacrifice things that you may be uncomfortable or not ready for the sake of progress. He is also a very encouraging and dedicated trainer - he even plans my workouts for me on days that I train alone, though he is not obliged to do so. I can see very visible progress in the short 4 months training under him - my arms have grown, I dropped 2 inches in waist size, I dropped 5% body fat, I can now dumbbell chest press 18kg now compared to 6kg when I started, honestly this list can go on. I highly recommend Roy to anyone who wants to get into shape but has no idea how to start or has never ever been to the gym before.

Also, my experience with the Paya Lebar outlet has been fantastic so far. You can really tell that a lot of effort has been put in by the staff to provide and maintain that premium feel, which makes going to the gym a more enjoyable and comfortable experience. Though this may be a more compact outlet compared to the other Virgin Active outlets in the CBD, honestly it has more than enough to cater to people with varying levels of fitness and interests. The gym is visited by both beginners and heavy lifters alike across all age groups and the classes are always fully booked. And by classes I mean reformer pilates, spin, bodypump and GRID training - yes all of these are available at Paya Lebar! I can see myself being a regular here for a very long time, and will strongly recommend everyone to give this gym a go if youre looking for a superb place to get a workout.",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,2441,2023
"The range of equipment is fantastic, and the staff is always friendly and helpful. The cleanliness and hygiene standards are top-notch, making me feel comfortable during my workouts. Terence is very enthusiastic, which makes me more confident during the workout period.",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,269,2023
"My most frequented branch, there is a wide range of classes here which I enjoy attending. Class timings range from morning 715am to 9pm at night so it's good for those working.

Unfortunately this particular branch is smaller and does not have as much facilities such as a pool, salt room, nap pods etc :( it is also lacking some machines such as hip adductors etc. But if you are not so concerned about variety of equipment and enjoy attending classes more which I do, this is a very cosy branch that is a stone's throw away from Paya Lebar MRT.

My relationship consultant Shana is very friendly, and always responds to any questions and queries I have quickly and promptly. Kudos to her! :)",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,693,2023

"Avan is an exceptional PT. Especially if youve been injured or are rehabbing an injury. Highly recommend.

Quality of Training:
The training sessions have been top-notch. The content was directly tailored to my needs, especially considering my L5/S1 disc issues. Every exercise and movement felt relevant to my condition and the effectiveness of the program has been evident in how Ive felt and progressed.

Progress Made:
Since starting the training, I have noticed a significant improvement in my mobility and pain management. The tailored exercises have made a difference in my daily life, and the emphasis on targeted training has allowed me to regain confidence in my physical capabilities.

Communication and Support:
Your communication and support have been exceptional. Sending videos for my reference to continue training at home was incredibly helpful. Your proactive approach in suggesting releases and other at-home remedies ensured that I always felt supported, even outside our scheduled sessions.

Overall Experience:
The most positive aspect of my training experience was the bespoke nature of the program. It was evident that you took the time to understand my condition and craft a training regime that was tailored to my needs. Your deep knowledge and expertise stood out in every session, making me feel confident and secure in the exercises we did.

Recommendation:
Absolutely, without a doubt, I would recommend Avan to others. Especially for those who are looking for specialised guidance and a program that is truly tailored to individual needs. Your talent, knowledge, and dedication are evident in every session.",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,1638,2023

"Having been a former member of a couple of other chain gyms in Singapore, my experience with Virgin Active has so far been the most pleasant. I appreciate the simple pricing system that gives me access to all their clubs, the staff are always welcoming and friendly, and I like the clean and well-appointed changing rooms. I frequent the Paya Lebar outlet the most often as its the most convenient and while its smaller than the other clubs (which have expanded facilities like swimming pools and Himalayan salt rooms), its adequate for my needs. What I like best are the variety of classes on offer. Theres Pilates, yoga, spin, boxing, and more and heres hoping VA will consider expanding the number of popular classes like Reformer (Align) in the future so that members have a higher chance of booking a slot.

One minor gripe I have is that you have to log into the Virgin Active MyLocker website to book classes, which strikes me as strangely archaic as even many of the smaller studios and gyms in Singapore these days have dedicated apps that allow you to book classes quickly and easily. The website seems prone to lags and crashes, and while theres a function that allows you to watch classes that are full, youll need to once again log in to find out if a slot has opened up. This wouldnt be a problem if there was an app that could send members notifications about slot openings.

That being said, my overall experience with VA has been good so far and with some improvements made to the technology, more classes offered throughout the day (and maybe more outlets across the island in the future?), theres no reason why it wouldnt be able to set the gold standard when it comes to chain gym brands in Singapore.",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,1721,2023

"Booked myself a Reformer class (11:30AM weekday) since I had an hour in between work calls and have been looking to try out VA in the area. I believe I made it pretty clear the moment I stepped foot into VA that it's my first time and am new to the studio.

Checked in at the counter where staff gave weird looks and no one came forward to give me a quick tour of their facility and / or directives as to where I could purchase my grip socks. I was early (got in 11:10AM) and was left to navigate the studio on my own (while experiencing the demeaning looks from VA staff).

The Reformer Beginner class was conducted by someone they outsourced, she isn't a Pilates instructor w VA, just here to stand in for another instructor. OK. The class was mediocre at best, sped through without much application of techniques such as alignment, breathing etc which are obv core to Reformer Pilates.

I do not encourage anyone to waste any time doing a class with them.

Adios VA.",1,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,969,2023

The facilities are well maintained too. A lovely atmosphere and Plus super location at PLQ. One of the best decisions I've made. Sign up!",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,451,2023
Lousy. Was closed on Christmas Day and did not put up notice nor any updates.,1,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,77,2023
"Ive been a member with VA for over 2 years but I have never thought of changing my membership to other brands because Im an advocator for good services and amazing facilities that any outlet of VA offers. I used to go to True and Anytime.

The personal touch of each outlets and the attention put in details are amazing. One great example is the machine to squeeze your wet clothes (have no idea what it is called), the toiletries available such as deodorant, body lotion and also amenities such as hair straightener (even for guys), iron board and the occasional partnership pop-up is such a great environment for all to enjoy.

Most importantly, the gym equipments are top notch and always serviced frequently so broken down machines are super rare. I havent mention, how thoughtfully each machines are arrange in a way that users dont really have to work far to go from one place to another.

When it comes to classes, I must say VAs classes are close to what private studios would offer. The quality of Yoga classes are on par if not better than half of Classpass studios. I will not compare with True because theirs is just a nightmare.

Last but not least, I just hope that they can maintain a healthy flow of gym goers as it can be quite crowded at peak hours or make my dream come true if they would open up a new outlet (maybe in Orchard since TEL line is now there).

I cant wait to go to other VAs around the globe and hope I can stay healthy with such a great environment to work out. I also hoped that the upper management can treat staff much better as Ive seen many left for better offers (quite sad to see some leave).

All in all, I love Virgin Active and this review speaks for all outlet here in Singapore.",5,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,1725,2023

"Very disappointed! The membership fee is almost 40% higher than fitness first and 60% higher than 24XFitness; both are nearby. Three cable stations are barely enough for the heavy flow of members using at peak hours; now, two malfunctions. I kindly reminded the staff that one cable station malfunctioned one week ago, and it remained the same one week later. When asked, its operation officer said that the station felt 'normal' to him, even though they said that the repair report was filed one week ago, and one of the personal gym trainers confirmed the issue after testing.

The staff dont know how to respond to customer complaints appropriately, is inactive, and lacks integrity by treating customers like fools and lies in front of clients' faces. Instead of fixing the issue itself, the staff tried to silence the complaining customer like they were scared that other customers would realise what kind of below-standard service the gym provides.",1,Virgin Active,Paya Lebar,954,2022

"I signed up for the promotion trial.
Pros:
- Paya lebar outlet is convenient for me and not as crowded as FF in the same vicinity
-Enjoyed the pool at Marina One outlet
-Generally good service. One lady at Marina one is particularly friendly

Cons:
-Classes are hard to book and repetitive. Everyday they do body pump and hard core (cant rmb the exact name) - but both has weights and hiit
- I enjoy Zumba but those classes are few and typically in Holland V outlet, during office hours or fully booked
-Confusion w promotion- what staff conveyed to us was inaccurate. when we reflected this to the staff, they were very rude and threatened to call the police if we don't pay for the 2 weeks. (This was even though we quoted our agent's name and furnished screenshots of conversation). After some time, they agreed to waive it.

"The classes are overbooked almost always. VA staff is nice and helpful but the management should stop being unfair to the users who are paying for the membership and yet, not getting to attend the classes they want.

"My second favourite VA Club! Staff members very friendly and always Welcomed us and greeted us with a big smile (really unlike the other outlets like Marina one). The gym floor is spacious and nice and my favourite reformer pilates class is by Fay. The best pilates instructor so far. Very experienced and guided us very well unlike other instructors who just give verbal cues and not help u fix your form etc.

Improvements:
- However I think the showers have to be improved. The flooding in the female toilets is quite disgusting.
- The shampoo and conditioner is also quite damaging to my hair. Considering the amount we pay I think it'll be good to invest in better quality shampoo and conditioners.
- Sometimes the towels are pretty nasty with some stains on them and they look very used.
- The VA membership has some discounts but it's very limited and not appealing. As someone who comes on the weekends for gym, discount partnerships with the restaurants like Rappu and featherblade are unavailable from Fri-sun. Which is quite sad... also the restaurant Goho has been closed for many months now. Please update the discount list and would like to suggest to bring in other trendier places. 10% discount is quite sad honestly. Suggestions to partner with acai affair/summer acai/more salad places/sbcd house or any other eateries nearby. Can also partner with like activewear brands like gymshark/alphalete/csb/lululemon.

Have had rude encounters with the staff time and time again even after contacting customers service.They have been nth but hostile and the treatment compared to other outlets are simply baffling!,1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,195,2024
"Been a member for a few months now.

The Club at Tanjong Pagar is poorly managed.

Cleanliness of the male shower room is disgusting.

The scheduling of the cleaner in the changing and shower area is always at peak hours.

They often (9 out of 10 times) run out of L size attire and socks during weekdays before 11 am their scheduled delivery time for next batch of clothing.

The cold plunge is down for at least 2 weeks.

Overall it's a nice facilities at Tanjong Pagar but it's POORLY managed compared to the other locations like Marina One.

Terrible especially when it's supposed to be the more expensive club.",1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,615,2024
"I arrived only three minutes late for a class, well within the five-minute grace period. I was allowed to check in at the front desk, but when I arrived at the studio, the trainer refused to let me join, stating, ""the class has started,"" and ignoring my attempts to clarify. He completely ignored me and turned to others by saying ""let's continue"". This inconsistent approach is both frustrating and unprofessional, especially when the club's own check-in policies were followed.

Having been a member with Fitness First and Pure Fitness, I have never encountered this level of disregard. Choosing to trust Virgin Active for a top-tier experience now feels like a significant mistake, and I am concerned this behavior may be a recurring issue after reading other reviews here.

I'd like to have response from Virgin Active with details on how this will be addressed to ensure a respectful and inclusive environment that aligns with Virgin Active's brand values.",1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,961,2024
"I had a fantastic experience at Virgin Active Tj. Pagar, thanks in large part to the exceptional service provided by Justine. She was incredibly attentive, ensuring that my trial session was informative and enjoyable. Shes been helpful in assisting me make a decision to join the gym.

The gym itself is well-equipped with newer machines and a clean environment. The classes are well-organized, I particularly appreciate the minimal setup required for classes, making it easy to join in.

I highly recommend VA to anyone looking for a top-notch gym experience.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,560,2024
ken is a horrible instructor,1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,28,2024
"Love it. Can't wait to see it post renovations.

----
Update in September 2024.

Love it post renovations.

I don't normally do Pilates but I have noticed that in this outlet the sheer amount of reformer beds in one setting isn't enough for 1 instructor. Unless all the attendees are seasoned Pilates goers.

They have many non official certified Pilates instructors too which sometimes translate to interesting classes...

To many beds per instructor means not enough time/concentration to correct everyone's postures and I can see injuries waiting to happen.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,560,2024
"Dealt with Justine. Insincere and incompetent. A gym membership is such a basic product but she can OFFER something and FAIL to deliver. And I'm not even sure if she realises what happens. Thus I rather warn others who are joining rather than sort this out with the gym, absolute waste of my time",1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,296,2024
"My second home. Friendly atmosphere. Great staff, sleep pods, and good gym equipment. Plenty of places to rest, relax, or exercise hard to your liking.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,151,2024
"I enjoyed going to Tanjong Pagar VA for a few reasons:
- my wonderful and committed PT, Vanessa!! She provided a lot of good cues and instructions on what to do with each machine and how to ensure I dont get injured when doing certain exercises be it on or off the machines. She meticulously followed up with me on the exercises that I learnt from my physiotherapists and incorporated them into my weekly training routine to ensure I maximised the chances of my legs recovery. She also specially curated a weekly programme for me to focus on strengthening my upper and lower body which I greatly appreciated her efforts! Look for Vanessa if you need an effective PT session!
- the staff esp. Zul and Nabil are extremely friendly and make the efforts to remember my name! I always feel so welcomed by them when they greet me by my name whenever they are at the counter. Their cheerful smiles and warmth personalities bring up the service level at this outlet!
- the gym area is bigger than some of the outlets though some of the machines might look a bit dated.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,1060,2024
"Spacious and clean gym with a wide range of machines and equipments, I come here on the daily and I am impressed with the high standards that the gym maintains in terms of cleanliness, order and service.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,203,2024
Thank you Isaac and the Operation Team for the prompt response which facilitated membership freeze request to be processed seamlessly.,5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,134,2024
Good gym space but shower room wall full of black mold . Look like not done cleaning daily . Dinning area ductbin are over full and no staff settle the bin that full.,3,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,166,2024
"Good experience and first impression at the gym. Was just looking around and the staff Justine was helpful, especially when showing the facilities. Professional, and very respectful. Overall an excellent experience",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,214,2024
"Poor service, rude staff. Don't recommend.

The staff member offered to show me around the studio after my first lesson. However, I ended up waiting for 10 minutes without any assistance, leading me to leave. Shortly after, I received a call from her and she was upset that I had left and demanded that I should have sought her out. Her tone was aggressive, and she expressed anger over my decision not to join the gym due to unfriendly staff--something my friend also experienced.

Furthermore, during our conversation, she shouted at me, stating that she let me in despite me being one minute late. In reality, she informed me that latecomers were not allowed to join the class, and she merely observed me attempting to enter from a distance. My friend was also denied entry due to being 10 minute late. While it is reasonable to not allow latecomers to enter, it should be conveyed to the customers clearly and the staff in VA did not manage to do that. There was no mention of any grace period nor any rules about late comers, even after my friend message them to inform that she would be late.

Overall a really unforgettable experience, the call left me feeling quite shaken because of how aggressive she was...",1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,1217,2024
"Very unfriendly and unprofessional place. Was 10 minutes late to a class and they denied entry entirely. Did not inform us on the no late entry policy at all. When asking for help from the receptionist, they were really dismissive and rude about it. Receptionists were very argumentative and not helpful at all. Take note that I did message them about me coming in late beforehand, and they replied but did not bother to mention this rule until I reached.

100% will not recommend this place. They also constantly call you and harass you to join the gym so I think it is bizarre that they never bothered to mention the policy :)

Thats not even the worst part. After my friends and I left, a staff member called us to ask us about out whereabouts (she was suppose to show us around the gym after class, but we waited for 10 minutes and no one contacted us). When we said that we left, the staff became very rude. My friend said that she would not be joining the gym anyway due to bad service and the staff then began to scold her, claiming that she should be glad she allowed her in despite her being 1 minute late. How ironic ",1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,1127,2024
Justine at VA Tg Pagar is great. I have yet to take up membership as I m in between another but Justine is patient and understanding of my club considerations. She takes time to identify your preference and needs to explore which VA facilities would be an advantage. She does not run a hard sell blindly. For this I will keep VA in mind for my next fitness club enrollment though more ex. MG,5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,391,2024
"Fantastic service and attitude from staff, Justine! The gym is clean and big, making the whole gym experience very positive.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,124,2024
"Ive been training with my personal trainer Ivan for the past 8 months, and I couldnt be happier with the results. Thanks to his patience and expertise, I achieved my very first unassisted pull-ups!
My overall fitness has significantly improved and seen a great transformation in my body composition. Ivan is incredibly patient and knowledgeable, tailoring each session to meet my specific goals and needs. I highly recommend him to anyone looking to make a positive change in their fitness journey!",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,498,2024
"I have always been wanting to try VA for a long time but the initial deterring factor was the price point, as compared to the next biggest competitor (Fitness First) in the area.

However, I did not regret joining VA membership after having experienced a wonderful service provided by the whole Tanjong Pagar team over the past two months here.

FOH:
I recalled dropping by on a late afternoon of Vesak Day to make an enquiry on what VA has to offer. I was immediately greeted by the pleasant team member as soon as I stepped out of the lift and was asked how I can be assisted. Having understand my enquiry, she had me seated while she paged for an available relationship consultant to meet up with me.

While waiting for my consultant, I took notice of the FOH checking in processes on a peak day. One word: SEAMLESS!

Within 15 seconds the whole check-in process was completed. While the member approach the first team member for check-in, the other 2 team members were already preparing the locker keys and workout attires. An additional person was on standby to assist any time to ease the waiting time where needed.

Im rather impressed at the level of meticulous planning the FOH manager must have taken into consideration in ensuring that the members get what they needed fast to start their session even during the peak-hours.

RELATIONSHIP CONSULTANT:
I was later greeted by Kishen my consultant. Really great welcoming personality and instantly connect on a personal level being able to understand my concerns, needs and past experiences I had with other brand clubs.

I was given a guided gym tour and explained what this studio has to offer in terms of facilities and equipments and spaces. Kishen also took the time to share the available packages based on my fitness needs and clarify any doubts I have regarding to the billing cycle and T&Cs.

FACILITIES:
The male locker room is very spacious, with an impressive minimum of 20 shower cubicles and over 200 lockers. The locker room has great ventilation system, and they have a locker room attendant readily on duty in ensuring the locker is well-maintained.

However, I do feel that the common corridor of the shower area could be better maintained, as it would get rather slippery during peak hours. I also felt that the maintenance of the lockers could be done a lot better, as the locks tend to be rather faulty. It gets really frustrating and I could occasionally hear other members frustrations too.

PERSONAL TRAINER:
I was quickly connected with my PT, Samuel, the following day after having signed up with VA and scheduled our one-time complimentary PT session.

Through our first session, I could sense the passion and enthusiasm Samuel has as a very young PT. He took genuine interests on assisting me in attaining my fitness goals, by asking many relevant questions, such as my past fitness experiences, dieting, working schedules and both short-term and long-term goals I hope to achieve.

After our first complimentary session, without hesitation I took up the 3-months training program with Samuel when he introduced the various PT packages offered by the club.

Over the past 2 months, with Samuels clear explanation and easy-to-follow exercises & training programs, I find myself easily attune to the training planned by him. With each PT session meet-up, Samuel will always make our training challenge, yet fun and enriching at the same time by introducing new exercise routines and machines to keep me engaged.

The one biggest wishlist that I would like to ask for, is to probably have an integrated program into the VLocker App; for the PTs and Trainees to track their individual training programs, and performances. This is to have a clearer visibility like how we can track our bills and bookings of classes.

Lastly, I would like to take this opportunity to show my heart-felt appreciation for Sameul and every one in the club; including the class facilitators, in making my fitness journey at VA a warm-welcoming and friendly place to be at. Great job!",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,4043,2024
"Initially, I was unsure about stepping out of my comfort zone and attempting to transform my body at the gym. I was overwhelmed by the thought of exercising in a gym filled with intimidating equipments and experienced individuals. Especially when I am unfamiliar with the techniques used in fitness training.

However, upon meeting Samuel, all of my doubts dissipated. His calm demeanor and encouraging attitude immediately put me at ease, and I knew that I was in good hands. Samuels dedication to my progress was evident from the beginning of our training sessions. His unwavering support and expert guidance instilled a newfound sense of confidence in me. With Samuel by my side, I am certain that I will conquer my fitness goals and achieve the results I have always dreamed of.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,782,2024
"Really thankful to have Nicole as my PT! Learnt a lot over the past 9 + month

Nicolas at virgin active is awesome ! Always so helpful & friendly! ,5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,68,2024
"Great facilities but once you've signed up, the service will be horrible. All they care about is scamming people with incorrect billing once you request to downgrade or cancel your membership. Seems like their staff who handles billing need to learn how to read!",2,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,262,2024
"My go-to gym. Has good range of equipment. Big gym floor. Has a pool. Only negative is that i have seen some VA trainers train during peak times (by themselves, no client)",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,171,2024
"I was introduced to Virgin Active Tanjong Pagar by one of the staff, Nicolas Tauvy. He is extremely helpful by recommending the best plan for my needs and is always so quick to provide assistance. Please reach out to him if you are interested to know what Virgin Active has to offer!

Additionally, I really enjoy the pilates and yoga classes in Virgin Active Tanjong Pagar! It's the best option for a working individual like me to exercise during my lunch break. The facilities and toilets are well-maintained, with hair dryers and straighteners available for females! I have tried other ClassPass classes but none fares better than Virgin Active.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,648,2024

I've been a member at virgin active for more than 5 years and love the partnership rates they have with AIA.

"I am extremely disappointed with Virgin Actives billing practices. Despite canceling my membership in a month's notice, I have been charged twice more.

"When asked to terminate membership since December, wasn't allowed it because ""reason was unaccepted"" and had extremely bad service by kishen, who basically MIA since January when asking questions about the gym services and credits and had no due diligence of serving his customers. I was charged past the minimum commitment period of 3 months (to March) since the membership and was continued to be charged further until now (May) without any notice and am unable to get any refund even when I did not use any of the facilities at the gym since signing the membership. Absolutely scam of money and not responsive and irresponsible agent that did not go through the term and conditions of the gym in order to sign and there was no due diligence of them for their job, please do not sign and get scammed.",1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,802,2024
"Vanessas exceptional as a personal trainer, tailoring each session to meet my specific needs and goals took the time to understand my strengths, weaknesses, and preferences, creating workouts that pushed me while also making each gym session enjoyable.

In addition to her expertise as a trainer, Vanessas genuine care for her clients shines through in everything she does. She goes above and beyond to provide support and encouragement, both inside and outside of the gym.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,473,2024

"This is an amazing and large gym that has recently undergone a facelift and has brought in many new facilities. Theres plenty of recovery tools like massage guns, automatic foam rollers, cold plunge and a steam room to name a few. The gym floor is large with plenty of machines (cable and plate-loaded), power racks (more than 10), free weights and benches. Some rare machines here too, like the rear delt row, hack quat, hip thrust and single leg hamstring curl are my favourites. The functional training area is also large enough to accommodate your own training, even if there are HIIT or Grid classes happening too. The trainers there are also friendly and professional, always willing to help out and offer advice if you ask! Ive been training with Roy Ho for over a year now and it has been a fulfilling journey of growth - I cannot recognise who I am in the mirror now compared to last year.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,898,2024

"sent my away dates to @virginactivesg to process the freezing of my membership from today (7th of May) until 6th of June. my exact email from that day (21st of April) was ""Kindly process the freezing of my membership for the next billing cycle 7th May until 6th June please""

instead of performing their duties to clarify with me that the billing date for May is on the 2nd instead of 7th, (which was a different debit date in March, which then i had to also freeze my account), i received a reply that my account would be frozen from ""2nd to 12 June 2024"", no word of 'May' was mentioned.

i replied this morning saying they got the dates wrong, because i realised my account was still active.

(btw in this email reply of yours ""2nd to 12 June 2024"", for anyone with an understanding as to how a person types/writes date would see that it was meant '2nd of June until 12th of June.')

now the rep is here telling me i should provide my flight ticket to help adjust the billing process, this was after telling me blatantly in the previous emails that they wouldn't be able to do a backdate on my request since the billing date for May was actually 2nd of May instead of 7th of May.

i am paying to have my account frozen - and as a paying member should i be providing any form of documentation to request for a service to be done? And which part of our email exchanges have you taken responsibility for your lack of clarity on this?",1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,1433,2024
"World class amenities and classes. It motivates me to keep coming back and getting my workout in.
However, I'm displeased with the service rendered. It's a world class gym with everything except a simple microwave for guests to use.
I carry my meal prep with me and it's really unpleasant to eat it cold after a workout. Have written in to suggest adding a microwave but no follow ups. On a few occasions, trainers and even a consultant told me that I can request the counter staff to help me heat it up when they are not busy (off peak hours).
Today I took the chance to ask the counter staff to help me heat up my lunch at 2.30pm ( there were many staff at the counter and no guests coming in and out) Instead, I was rejected by them and they said that the microwave is only for staff.
Why the double standards when the trainers (at least 3 of them have told me it's ok) and consultant have told me that the counter staff have helped others do it. Really unsatisfied and disappointed with the service.",3,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,1003,2024
"PT: 5/5, VA: 1/5

Ive been training with Iqmal frequently, and I cant recommend him highly enough! He is incredibly knowledgeable, motivating, and supportive. Thanks to his personalized workouts and guidance, Ive seen amazing progress in my fitness goals.

However, regarding Virgin Active (VA), I must express dissatisfaction. The facilities and class standards leave much to be desired, with equipment having broken leather seats, making it uncomfortable to use. With the departure of experienced instructors, the quality of classes has declined significantly. Additionally, Ive encountered frequent instances of double charging, and the refund process is excessively cumbersome and protracted. Customer service needs to be more proactive in addressing these issues.",2,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,768,2024

I cancelled the next class which is back to back. Incurred penalty which I emailed the tanjong pagar team but no response to waive it off. P.S if you cancel after 9pm the day before for a class you get a penalty, Cancelled within 1 hr you get 2 penalty. After 6 penalty you only get to book 1 class per.month.
It cost more than 200++ per.mth and they impose such a rigid penalty.",1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,550,2024
"Great gym, friendly staff, highly recommended",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,45,2024
"One of the best choice made after joining VA was to engage Marcus Ong as my personal trainer. Marcus is helpful to everyone on the gym floor. He is always ready to guide the members on the use of the equipments, offering advice on exercises and watching out for members to ensure their safety. As a personal trainer, Marcus is very patient and knowledgeable. He takes time to understand my goals and limitations, takes into consideration my work schedule when designing my exercise regime. He balances our training with both intensive and moderate sessions and incorporates a wide variety of workouts to ensure each session remains fresh.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,638,2024
"I visited Virgin Active in 2021 for a trial session. During that time, a personal trainer inquired about my interest in purchasing a package/or to engage her as my personal trainer to which I declined. However, in 2024, I received an email from the Singapore Commercial Credit Bureau claiming I owe $1,600 SGD.

I have not consented to any packages nor have I been provided with this contract for personal review or signature. The uploaded documents show no signature from me suggesting that someone, possibly the trainer, entered my name onto the contract without my consent.

Its shocking that such practices occur within a reputed company. I advise caution when participating in any trial offers.",1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,699,2024
"The service is not the best. The staff are rude, biased and selectively friendly. They either ignore me or speak rudely. Once someone else shows up beside me, they become attentive, friendly and smiley. Apart from this, first time I was there, I couldn't find the exit as I was in a rush and went the wrong way. I asked the cleaner and she pointed and started laughing. She even told the rest of the staff and they laughed too. What kind of customer service is this?? Staff are just laughing, being rude and judgemental.",1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,520,2024

Decided to take a look around gyms in CBD area and was reached out by a friendly sales representative Jolenta. She has been really helpful in explaining the facilities/membership options with the AIA benefit when I was not even aware of it. Receptionists were also very welcoming and place was brightly lit. Definitely ideal for a workout any day,5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,346,2024
"I really enjoyed the gym facilities in Virgin Active, it feels like I'm not just coming in for a quick gym session but rather experiencing a therapeutic lifestyle in a fitness and wellness haven that has everything from classes, gym equipment to a super nice outdoor swimming pool and even a salt room?!

Jolenta was very helpful in assisting with my enquiries for a personal trainer and Vanessa who is the PT made me felt very comfortable during training as I am usually quite intimidated handling the equipment in the gym alone. Vanessa really tailors the schedule and routine to my needs and current workout schedule so it feels really personalised. She even advised me about my dietary and nutrition plans which would be very useful for my overall fitness goals.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,766,2024

"Very passive aggressive with some attitude sales lady (Filipino). I made appointment online prior to meeting her at the gym to show me around. Once she saw me she said: oh i never thought you would look like this. I said: what do you mean? She said: oh nevermind. After she showed around i agreed to try the trial class. In the conversation she mentioned the gym is more targeting on the expats hence the gym implement biweekly payment. Been asking her to send me a whatsapp of the pricing etc. Never send to me until i asked again (how stupid i was) and she just brushed me off: oh i never send you is it? 
Long story short i decided not to come back and she ended up whatsapp me to check on the status. I'm not an ""expat"" or maybe i look too poor so that's why she doesn't even bother to follow up on my request whatsoever. Very poor attitude for a foreigner herself.",1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,869,2024
"I joined Virgin Active after a minor stroke, with further complications of elevated BP.
Keeping healthy and fit became a non-negotiable part of my daily routine. It was not easy for a person with previously sedentary life style and my personal trainer Rudy have been absolutely indispensable in that journey.

Rudy demonstrated considerable acumen and proficiency in managing and reducing my elevated blood pressure levels. He accomplished this through the incremental enhancement of my cardiovascular efficiency.

Rudy has consistently exceeded my anticipations by demonstrating exceptional insight into monitoring my physical activities, vo2 max, and simultaneously providing mental stimulation through humor during our sessions. His sessions have always been characterized by a pleasant blend of productivity and light-heartedness, which I have found to be highly enjoyable.

Owing to Rudys professional intervention, I have experienced significant improvements in my health. This has not only improved my quality of life but has also enabled me to attain the lifestyle that I have always desired. I express my sincere gratitude to Rudy for his diligent and professional assistance.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,1185,2024
Justine is very professional and friendly!,5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,42,2024
"It has been my distinct honor to collaborate with Rudy in a professional coaching capacity, and his services come with my highest endorsement. With a career that spans over two decades, Rudys proficiency contributed significantly to my personal fitness goals, including a reduction of 3 kg in Fat mass, an increase of 2.5 kg in Muscle definition, and a decrease in Body Fat by 5%. His emphasis on mobility improvement has been a pivotal factor for my well-being, particularly given the constraints of a traditional office environment. Rudys strategic approach in customization of workout regimens, coupled with his motivational tactics, have been instrumental in reshaping my fitness trajectory. For anyone seeking tangible results and a personal trainer who prioritizes clients health above all, Rudy is the most suitable choice.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,830,2024
"My experience with Virgin Active Tanjong Pagar has been exemplary from the outset. After signing up for a trial online, Nicolas promptly reached out, offering a detailed and enthusiastic overview that set the stage for a promising start. The warm welcome extended during my first visit, where Jo provided an insightful tour of the facilities and classes, coupled with Jo and Justines clear and enticing explanation of membership benefits, made the decision to join an easy one. The facilities impressed with their maintenance and user-friendliness, contributing to a seamless initiation into the gym environment.

The high point of my early days at Virgin Active was a complimentary Personal Training (PT) session with Vanessa, whose professionalism and personalized approach were so convincing that I signed up for a 3-month PT package. This level of personalized attention and quality service has made me extremely satisfied with my decision to join Virgin Active Tanjong Pagar. The teams commitment to fostering a supportive and motivating fitness environment has greatly exceeded my expectations, making my fitness journey both positive and rewarding.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,1155,2024
Equipment and vibe is very good. Employees are very friendly. Just a bit too expensive and too little outlets.,5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,110,2024
"Met with Nicolas at Tanjong Pagar to enquire about a gym membership and was really helpful with everything. Aside from the amazing amenities, he really set the place apart from the other gyms and decided to join on the spot. Don't regret it a single bit and have been going almost every day!",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,291,2024
"Amazing club, equipment and facility is on point. Staff is very friendly and helpful!",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,85,2024
I just signed up virgin 1 Jan but I had really poor experience in the past 1 month or so. Yoga instructor Lynn didn't show up to class twice! I was not allowed to enter Shirley's body pump class as I was 1 min late. The class just started to warm up. Another guy came in later than me was allowed to get in becoz he was here earlier but he didn't start warm up either just as me. This is too rigid and cruel. People are allowed to get into other classes within 5 mins late here.,1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,478,2024
Nice location and space. Met with Justine of VA Tanjong Pagar who made the sign up process seamless!,5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,100,2024
"Honestly really love the gym and facilities here. Corporate discount makes it super affordable. Jo was really helpful at showing me around, sharing about Virgin Active and also onboarding me. Would strongly recommend her and the gym.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,233,2024
"Went to compare a few gyms around the area and Virgin Active stood apart from the rest with their facilities, equipment, and the staff. They are currently doing some renovation and added a recovery station for stretching with a few new machines, which is a great addition!
There are also a ton of classes, at all hours (they book up fast!) And so far, my experience has been pretty positive.

Nicolas, who was my consultant took his time to show me everything and explain the options, is also very responsive whenever I have questions or need help, another great bonus!

May not be the cheapest gym in SG but I definitely think that is worthwhile, especially if you watch out for their promotions!",4,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,697,2024
Special shout out to Kishen who went over the call of duty to help resolve a random problem I had encountered with the booking system after office hours. Thank you!,5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,164,2024

"I joined Virgin Active a few months back with the help of their sales manager Nicolas. I highly recommend going through him if you are interested since he has not only helped me get started but also assisted with every one of my requests ever since with urgency!
The classes and facilities on top of his great help really what motivated me to join VA! *",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,353,2024
"Met with trainer Nicole and it was an enjoyable experience. In the beginning I was intimidated by the machines and worried that I would feel embarrassed but trainer Nicole was friendly and patient which made me feel comfortable and confident to do the exercises.

This is the first time, I had close guidance and professional advice/ tips. Nicole made things easier as she takes time to go through small steps gradually so I did not feel overwhelmed or lousy about myself.

The overall experience felt like it was very personalised and hands-on unlike other gyms where it can feel like the trainers rush and go and give very commercial standard sessions.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,654,2024
"Used to be a good gym, but right now is a no no
1. Very limited areas to workout as it is on renovations plus they make clases all day on the open area ( so you can't train on your own)
2. Noise levels are unhealthy - they have instructors yelling on a microphone in the open areas, each instructor plays its own music on top of the background gym music (not even the best noise canceling earbuds help)
3. Showers are dirty full of hair and lime at any time of the day even very early in the morning (as they didn't clean it for the day before)

I used to love this place but current management is not taking care of providing a good service - it is not just about having machines, it's about a place that is conductive to working out",1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,734,2024
"This expansive club boasts modern facilities, featuring a clean and well-lit changing area that is meticulously maintained. However, my disappointment arises from the absence of Rpm classes, especially with the recent closure of the Bugis branch and ongoing renovation affecting classes. The limited availability of cycling classes is a drawback. Over my six years with Virgin Active, Ive noticed a constant rise in membership fees coupled with a decrease in offerings compared to the past. Several excellent instructors had left in recent years. I hope for more innovative experiences and unique propositions to be introduced, enhancing the clubs appeal and retaining loyal customers.",2,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,685,2024
"Overpriced membership fees, the gym is getting more crowded and the classes getting more difficult to book. Planning to cancel my membership after my 1 year contract ends",1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,170,2024
"Had a very poor experience during my free trial at this gym. So happy I tried before committing to a membership. It started with the website and apps not accepting my mobile number. Tried calling, no answer. Went there in person and it took more than 30 mins and 3 different staff members to try and sort out the issue. Then when I finally got the pass, I was left to try and work out everything alone - no one bothered to show me where things were, how to use the lockers etc. Given the number of staff at the front desk, this is not acceptable. Then the machines that I came to use were constantly occupied so I got annoyed and left. Wont be returning.",1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,654,2024

"2/5 for the gym
5/5 for my personal trainer Thapelo
He helped me get in shape for my wedding in a short span of time (2 months) and was very adaptive with my workout plan during and after my wedding
I got to know of his services when I approached him for some questions on my workout plan and he suggested some helpful tips without withholding information. This made me feel comfortable to opt for his services and had 100% trust in him and his abilities. I would look forward to each session, as it was fun and focused at the same time.
Can't recommend Thapelo enough!!",4,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,570,2024
"Joined the club during my student years. Having had a musculoskeletal condition for years, this club had provided me facilities that accommodated for my rehabilitation and recovery, by doing Reformer Pilates and Yoga. There are a lot of different classes to choose from throughout the day (morning to evening) with different instructors, ranging from beginner, intermediate, to advanced level reformer, and various types of yoga; align (hatha), flow (vinyasa), and calm (yin and restorative). Moreover, VA has a few branches that are located quite strategically. The classes are easily booked through the VA app.

Jessica is my favourite Yoga Instructor. I like the way she leads the class through the gentleness of her voice, how she gives instructions, and how she paces the shift from one posture to another. Though it may be a big class, she was able to observe, recognise, and correct the practitioners form and alignment (didnt inform her that I had the condition in the beginning, but she could tell). She was able to kindly tell not to force doing certain movements/postures, and to give alternatives to those who need it. All in all, most of the Pilates and Yoga instructors are great and have different strengths/ways on how they lead the classes, so one may book and access the classes according to their schedule, location and instructors preferences.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,1363,2024
Jo has been great helping me set up my gym journey!,5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,51,2024
I signed up for PT in Virgin Active and was trained by Thapelo for the past few months. Thapelo is an experienced and supportive trainer who greatly impacted my fitness journey. His expertise and encouragement were invaluable in my progress. Grateful for his guidance!,5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,268,2024

I will definitely be returning to Virgin in my future trips to Singapore.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,259,2024
"I completed a 3 month personal training program at VA with Thapelo (personal trainer). He planned out a training schedule which is split into 3 phases that focuses on different goals (endurance/ strength/ cardio, etc). Throughout the program, Thapelo consistently tries to get me to try harder (which is one of the motivations i told him i wanted to have in me at the start), while at the same time ensuring that I kept my form during the exercises. I definitely feel a lot stronger than before and I would recommend him to anyone considering a PT.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,548,2023
"I love this club! The facilities are great and the staff are super friendly and professional. I also had a great PT experience with Thapelo. He worked me hard, but with a kind and caring manner I really appreciated. I managed to become the strongest I've been, ever, and I'm 42! Thanks Thapelo, it's been great working with you ",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,328,2023
Disappointing service. Failed to revert on the enquiries. Have been trying to call the hotline multiple times provided on the website but no one picked up. Went to counter three times & have been speaking to the staff but there was no follow-up. Texted membership services on the matter but there was no follow up.

"One of our favourite outlet for weekly HITT by Rue and Hot Yoga by Hayley.

Both instructors are great motivators to hit the intense work out and good strecth with inbalance posture like crow and headstand during the Hot Yoga session with Hayley. You go girls!!",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,261,2023
"I was looking for a good gym and personal trainer to sign up with hence I went to a few gyms at Tanjong Pagar to recee. My last stop was to this branch. Daniel Tan oriented me around the whole area of VA and was the most sincere, patient, kind, attentive, caring and utmost professional and he even stayed with me till 9 plus pm at night. He genuinely cares about my needs, concern and wants. Without his patience and kindness, I don't think I would have signed up with VA so soon since there are so many good gyms in Singapore to explore. He signed me up for the reformer Pilates trial class and stayed back late to make sure to send me into my first class. Later, he even cared to check how was my first lesson ever. I was utterly impressed by the level of professionalism, service and care. Daniel is a real asset to VA Tanjong Pagar. It wouldn't be the same without him.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,874,2023
Loving the yoga classes here in Virgin Active. All of the instructors are very friendly and professional. Specifically loving Hayley's classes! ,5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,144,2023
"I've been a member for 3 years and leaving a detailed review.

Gym floor: 3 stars
there has been no equipment upgrade all this while. It was rather embarrassing when my friends at cheaper gyms like Anytime Fitness and ActiveSG gyms have even basic equipments like rear delt flies / pec fly, hack squats, hip thrust machines and etc. I hope VA will step up to include more new machines. There are too many cardio machines that are not fully utilised so surely there's a better way to optimise the gym floor.

PT: 5 stars
I had the privilege of engaging Kah Wei for PT and his expertise, patience and knowledge is top-notched. He keeps himself updated with the latest science in power building, nutrition, hypertrophy, etc and even designed a program for me. I'm sure he has much more to offer when it comes to another client with different goals.

Kah Wei understood my fitness goals, lifestyle and needs and has always been patient in guiding me through and explaining the workouts. He even responded to my queries via text. You can't get a better trainer than this.

Yoga classes: 5 star
Lynne's expertise was evident as she guided us seamlessly through various yoga styles and poses. Lynne's clear communication made even the most complex poses feel accessible.

She exuded empathy, always attuned to our emotional and physical well-being, creating a supportive and nurturing atmosphere. Her encouragement was motivating, pushing us to explore our boundaries without any judgment.

Lynne's positive attitude was infectious. The sharing of yoga philosophy also integrated well into the class and serves as timely takeaways for us to bring back home and also to our office.",4,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,1673,2023
Classes and facilities are good. However there's always a lot of used gear and towels left in the shower and changing area. Brought this up before but nothing has been done about it,2,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,181,2023
"I had the pleasure of practicing yoga with Georgia for Hot Flow and Yoga Calm for a trial class on 24/9/2023. She is an exceptional yoga instructor who excels in promoting both mental and physical well-being. Georgia possesses a deep understanding of yogas holistic benefits, and their classes reflect this expertise.

One of her standout qualities is her excellent communication and clear instructions. She creates a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere in each class, making even beginners feel comfortable with her modifications and progressions for advanced practitioners. Georgia is adept at tailoring the practice to suit individual needs, ensuring that everyone can progress at their own pace.

She incorporates mindfulness and meditation seamlessly into yoga sessions, helping me find inner peace and reduce stress. Physically, Ive noticed increased flexibility, strength, and overall well-being.

I highly recommend Georgia to anyone seeking a yoga instructor who not only fosters physical health but also provides valuable tools for mental well-being. Her expertise, clear communication, and warm personality make her a standout choice for anyone on their yoga journey.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,1177,2023

Through my gym life, I love to take Jessica T's yoga class regularly. It was my first time to try yoga in my life, and I became loving yoga because of her. I am satisfied that my flexibility has been changed and always feel good physically and mentally after taking her class. I strongly recommend to take her class if you are looking for a great yoga instructor.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,494,2023

"Ever since VA Marina One stopped offering yoga lessons, I've made it a point to visit the Tanjong Pagar branch weekly for Hayley Chen's yoga lessons. This is despite the fact that the facilities and showers are much cleaner and newer at MO (more on this later).

I appreciate how Hayley goes above and beyond for her students (of varying levels of proficiency). She is proactive and professional, demonstrating and actively checking our postures. I've never seen her be late for class and she is amicable to both club members and those on Classpass. I love the playlists she personally curates for her lessons - I've saved it into my Spotify - as the music really sets the ambience for the yoga session. Classes are NEVER stopped short ahead of time and she is always happy to provide her advice and guidance whenever approached.

Being a rather tall person who's never had exposure to flexibility or mobility exercises, I was always stiff and could never bend over to touch the ground. It was only after I started practising yoga with Hayley - who was so accepting of the newbie me - that my flexibility improved. My fingers are now able to reach the ground. I know I'm still a WIP but I am forever grateful!

Would not have given anything short of 5 stars for Hayley but I'm deducting 1 star because the upkeep of VA Tanjong Pagar isn't really good. Toilet cubicles are often out of toilet paper. As for the shower cubicles, it's not uncommon that the shower gel/shampoo runs out, or that the water flow/pressure is less than ideal. I'm not trying to nitpick, but for a monthly membership fee ranging in the hundreds, I would expect a better quality.

Nevertheless, overall, I'm a pleased member and will continue to visit VA TP for my yoga classes with Hayley. Keep up the good work!",4,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,1786,2023
"I've tried most gyms/classes in Tanjong Pagar and the classes here are my favourite! Staff are super lovely.

Huge Shoutout to Hayley for Pilates!! I love her Friday and Saturday classes. Her classes are fun and make me work really hard hard. It's made me exercise more often ",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,276,2023

In the span of 3-4 months I was able to gain 4kg of muscles, and learn a lot of new techniques and correct my form for some exercises. Even after our sessions ended, by following the exercise plan he made for me, I was able to lose around 9 kg, but still retain the muscle mass. Overall, it made my gym sessions much more motivating, and I could actually see a lot more results from my sessions.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,633,2023
Is Rudy Singapores best trainer? I am a slightly older male who had a few muscular issues. I trained with Rudy for a year and my physical well-being improved out of sight. His sessions were always positive and interesting helped by his positive outlook on life.I would definitely recommend him as your next PT.,5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,310,2023

"Update: 2023
I have to make a big call out to Rudy Rahman a Personal Trainer who played a pivotal role in my recovery following cervical artificial disc replacement surgery.
I went from having the mobility of a T-Rex to regaining full mobility and strength. Very few PTs are truly skilled in rehabilitation, Rudy is one who most definitely is.

Original review.

A gym that offers state of the art facilities, the gym is clean, the staff are super friendly and helpful. Best club in town.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,488,2023
"A lot of machines under maintenance (stair master has been missing for moths, same for ercolina - still missing today).

Because of that you end up waiting...

Not as premium as the price suggest but still fine.

The staff is really lovely though",4,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,246,2023
Joined Virgin Active at Tanjong Pagar recently and I am enjoying every aspect of it. Classes are amazing and fun and definitely would recommend trying them out! The staff there is really friendly and special thanks to Nicolas Tauvy who has been assisting with me from the start and has made my experience more enjoyable!,5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,320,2023
"I have been a member of Virgin Active Tanjong Pagar for nearly 4 years now and I must say that being a gym owner myself there is no doubt in my mind that this club delivers the best experience on sooooo many levels to its clients.

being a gym owner in the past its very very tricky to please all clients and upkeep maintenance, the Annual maintenance costs , overheads of housekeeping supplies and rental is a lot of strain for this industry already and while customer experience is crucial in soo many aspects we also must have some compassion before complaining too much about the upkeep of facilities and lack of maintenance when clearly we are members can do our part by being respectful to how we use equipment .

Being mindful of our surroundings and having compassion is enough and free of cost that we can offer, the regular wear and tear of equipment will happen and be maintained.

I have never had a bad experience and maybe if we stick to the purpose a gym provides which is fitness and focus on improving our overall wellness then maybe we can progress beyond complaining.

Yes there is scope for improvement like the clothes provided , they are really weird in size and the color compared to the raffles and marina one branch but overall the experience is very pleasant and consistent performance from the team :-)

Good job guys :-)",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,1348,2023

Big workout area.,5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,17,2023
"As a first-time gym-goer, I must say that my experience at this fitness center has been nothing short of exceptional. From the moment I walked through the doors, I was greeted by a friendly and knowledgeable staff member named Alex.

Alex went above and beyond in showing me around the gym and highlighting all the top-notch facilities available to members. He was patient and attentive as he explained the pros and cons of each membership type, ensuring that I fully understood all the options before making any commitment.

What truly impressed me was Alexs genuine interest in helping me achieve my fitness goals, rather than simply trying to sell me a membership. Unlike other pushy salespeople Ive encountered in the past, Alexs approach was refreshingly authentic and personalized.

Overall, I must say that I am thoroughly impressed with this gym and the top-notch customer service that Alex provided. Thanks again for your assistance!",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,942,2023

"A piece of gym equipment fell and nearly crushed me due to poor maintenance and rusted floor bolts. A piece of equipment I have used multiple times a week with no problems for months.

Not surprised. A lot of broken and poorly maintained equipment.

The member of gym staff blamed me for the collapse. Shocked, the member of staff who was on his phone while not watching his own client while attempting to deliver personal training. Super professional trainer.",1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,460,2023

"Very clean, spacious and filled with natural light!!",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,52,2022
"Please be careful and consider carefully before signing anything with VA. I visited the gym on a 1 time trial, the gym experience itself was good. So I signed up for a promo online that suits my needs. Once a week club visit for $30 dollars/ week ($30 dollar (is half price promo)/ week for 10 weeks with 12 weeks commitment period, means after the first 10 weeks, I will be paying $60dollar/week).

The supposed link for the specific terms before signing was not working at all (even until today and having counter check it with another browser type and another friend on their mobile/ pc). I made the mistake of assuming it is as straightforward as how it was marketed - one club visit a week. So I paid anyway and read through all the club rules and contract pdf that was sent as soon as I paid. It states nothing about how many classes i could go during the one club visit a week. The club rules pdf and website for class booking mylocker states 6 bookings at any give time and the contract does not indicate anything about class booking. At the end, through my own experience for a month I then realize it is 1 class booking = 1 club visit = 1 credit for each week.

The customer service team responds, but are mostly unaware of promotion details stating its a fairly new promotion or give wrong information which confuses you. At the end, they will just tell you theres nothing that can be done since youve already committed 12 weeks (after 10 weeks you will be charged $60dollar for 1 class booking in a week which is super expensive). The only option given is to appeal (depending on approval) for a change in membership type to contract even longer for unlimited club visit, but seeing their poor customer service I doubt they care very much about their individual members I decide to get this over and done with and return to Fitness First. Probably VA business model only cares about corporate membership which brings them bigger bucks.

Update 9th Nov 22: they actually change the site to specify its 1 club visit/ class per week now for a similar package i took (my friend was considering it so we went to check the site last 2 weeks). But they refuse to refund or even apologize for their mistake before.",1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,2218,2022
"Pretty spacious and clean. If you ever need a trainer and do not know who to choose, I recommended Ivan to be your trainer. Pretty knowledgeable and will help you to achieve your goals.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,185,2022
"Be extremely careful about signing anything with this gym, especially with the physical trainer Aizuddin Syam. His explanation of the PT offering is just misleading, and I ended up with more classes than I said I wanted. He had sold me a fixed number of classes, but in fact it was a perpetual subscription model. They have an auto-debiting system and simply continued debiting fees for PT fees. I found out too late that I had to initiate canceling the debiting otherwise they will carry on with it perpetually. There was no notice or reminder that the minimum commitment for classes had been met. I tried to obtain a refund for the excess classes after explaining, but didnt manage to.

While it feels really scammy, I wouldnt say it was blatant dishonesty, but I think their processes could be shaped up to prevent miscommunication. They also made little attempt to address my complaint and simply brushed it off, which I thought was extremely disappointing considering its a premium gym with premium fees. I would have continued being a member but they leave me no choice.

Would avoid this gym.",1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,1099,2022

Excellent gym with all the right facilities you need,5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,52,2021
"extremely disappointed with virgin active. I have supported them since they opened in singapore 5 years ago. in Jan 2020, I signed up for a 2 year plan. paying 180/month for the convenience of going for classes, popping by the gym whenever my work allows me time for it. then covid happened and they froze my membership. Im now locked in till October 2022. however its a very different gym. classes are always booked, in fact it gets booked up the minute the time opens, I have to book a slot to use the gym. due to the nature of my work, I supported virgin because it was accessible all the time, now its accessible only if you book a few days in advance. essentially I can never use the gym.

I brought my concerns to the staff and they said there was nothing they can do. they they will check and come back- they never did, I thought that was poor customer service, especially a client for 5 years. Cancellation fee was 700. makes no sense to pay 700 to save 180*22months. I tried to appeal on the back of the fact that I am a repeat customer and if they let me off with 200 cancellation fee, the likelihood of me re-signing with them when covid restrictions ease is probably 99%. and I probably have to work for the next 20 years and intend to keep fit as well.

essentially, they are willing to earn my 3.9k for the next 22 months, than give me a 500 discount on the cancellation fee and potentially have me as a loyal customer back for perhaps the next 20 years- or about 43k assuming prices dont increase. in short, they are willing to save 500 to risk losing 43k.

perhaps times are bad and they need that 500 today. or the person I spoke with doesnt really care, or the club in general doesnt really care. either way, they did nothing wrong, I signed a contract so they are entitled to enforce it. I just thought the decision making wasnt very long sighted. pretty sure Richard Branson would be happy to lose 500 today then lose 43k over the next 20 years. then again why does he even care about 43k.

I am going to try and appeal again. I sincerely hope they can do something about this. but I want to urge the public to be very careful when you sign any deal with Virgin active. the facilities are great and so are the classes. but be mindful of the probability of getting those classes. they are very low. I used to go the Virgin 3 times a week, now with the restrictions its 1 time a month. my lifestyle has not changed, its just the booking process and circumstance.

if anyone is considering signing virgin, just be mindful of my story. thanks",1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,2558,2021

"Edited on Nov 13:
This used to be my favourite Virgin Active outlet, however the service level dropped significantly after lockdown. In addition to other peoples comments, it is unbelievable that the club has been short of face towels for a few months. I mean, how difficult it is to get new towel stock from Fairprice across the street?

Also, the restroom basin is the most inconvenient design ive ever seen. There is a huge mirror right in the middle of the basin, only about 20cm from your face, which rightfully blocks the faucets. It is impossible to wash face, or wash hands without bending ( to look for the faucet).

While there are multiple disinfect spray bottles around as safety measure, many of them are with spoilt spray head. No one ever checks when filling the bottles?

Have been a member for one month, and in love with the facility. Very convenient access to multiple outlets in CBD area, the member experience is good so far (noticed that they set guest pass price bar to control the crowd). One con is the Grid area (aka open training area) is often occupied by back to back group classes after 6pm. For people dont attend classes, many facilities like battle ropes, TRX cannot be used during the time period.",2,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,1231,2020
Pricey,2,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,6,2020
Extreme bad customer experience. Overcharge hundreds of dollars when I have clearly indicated that I do not want to continue my PT anymore. Cannot book any class due to the limited classes. Hugely disappointed and encourage everyone to terminate with Virgin.,1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,258,2020
"Their customer service is terrible! My trainer quit without any advance notice and I still had pending sessions left which I had paid for. I asked for a refund and they said, they will get back to me. Nobody called me back. I called again and again and each time I was told that they will get the manager to call me back. This went on for 9 months. Meanwhile, I ended up cancelling my membership. And so they finally said, since you have cancelled your membership, you have lost the outstanding PT sessions! I have also been asking them to send me invoices of the payments I had made for 2020. I was told they will email it to me but weeks later, nothing came. Have followed up again and hoping I will receive the details this time!

Really poor experience. Definitely not joining them again.

Update: finally received the invoices.",1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,832,2020
"Just cancelled my membership. I was charged unfairly for a full cycle (90$) and also a freeze fee (20$) that was waivered during the lockdown and phase 2 and suddenly was reinstated without any notification. On top of that, one of their trainers verbally harassed me which I wrote a long email about. A group of scammers and I am so tired of them.

"I loved this gym!
Pros:
Firstly, there is no hard selling tactics used like other gyms in the neighborhood. They are transparent about their rates online, unlike other gyms that will give you a special price on immediate sign up type of offers.
They deliver what they charge for, the gyms are sparkling, class apart from most gyms. The vibrant ambience, the facilities, tons of equipment, healthy cafe, space and lots more makes anyone look forward to work out time.

Cons:
- For a location like tanjong pagar where there is residential crowds as well as office crowds, they could do with classes during the non-peak hours too. Classes were always too full at peak hour.
- At the end of my contract, I faced some challenges ...(I didnt end it because I didnt like the gym but I was relocating) and ofcourse there is always a one-off case but many businesses with membership contracts like gyms, phone companies have such issues, so no surprise there. Though I must say the staff were very helpful and resolved the issue within the week.",4,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,1036,2020

"One of the top notch gyms in town, and understandably more pricey than others so that it's not so crowded. Best classes (in my opinion) are hot yoga and altitude.

Roughly members would pay $200+ a month for a 12 or 24 months package but they charge you by weeks I.e 52 weeks or 104 weeks. There's plenty of equipment and interesting facilities. There's a pool shared with Sofitel, Himalayan salt inhalation room, sleeping pods for the busy executives wanting a quick nap, yoga studios, les mils classes (bodycombat, bodypump) and workout area with free weights. What I love is their threadmills machines come with Netflix (you need your own account) and YouTube! There's complimentary attire they would rent to you, and also shower facilities and hair dryers etc. lockers are available as well. Everyday there would be fruits in a basket and free tea and coffee and water :)",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,875,2020
"I almost didnt get a subscription here, but Im so happy I ended up getting one, and thats all thanks to JJ. I arrived at the gym quite late, it was after 9pm. I already had another gym in mind, but as I was nearby I decided to take a look at Virgin Active too. JJ was both professional and friendly (I didnt expect so much positive energy from someone at 9pm) and explained to me with lots of patience what is included. He kind of convinced me to get the subscription - great communication skills! Now I can say that I definitely made a good choice. Its been a month since Ive been using the gym 5-6 times/ week and its everything and much more than I expected. The changing room is clean, spacious and bright, it provides multiple hairdryers, towels and gym clothes. The training room is spacious and has enough equipment, even on the peak hours its easy to find something available. The gym has a wonderful view that you can enjoy when using the treadmill. I tried a few of the classes and my favorite by far is Grit - short, but intense. I also liked the hot yoga class.

"This review is for the Tanjong Sorry for the inconvenience Pagar location.

The gym is conveniently located ontop of the Tanjong Pagar MRT station. Often times one of the few Virgin Active locations open on public holidays.

Be prepared to face many broken machines, non-functioning amenities such as steamrooms being broken or wifi being down, full or unbookable classes, blaring music, and an unfriendly janitorial staff.

This all makes sense though because the gym is just so affordable. With rates around only $55 a week (nearly $3,000 a year) who could expect a premium experience.

Quite a few of my friends who are regulars of the Marine One branch have spoken poorly of the Tanjong Pagar branch and I cant say that I disagree.

Being pretty new to the Tanjong Pagar branch, I asked for some help and directions because I couldnt find my way around. The staff at the counter was very impatient with me and spoke to me like I should already know everything. They also managed to lose my gym member card and told me they cant do anything about it. When I prompted them further to give me a proper solution, they told me to get it reprinted at Marine One. Such great service recovery. I honestly think the service staff here should go check out their counterparts at the Marina One and Paya Lebar branches to learn a thing or two about customer service.",2,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,940,2019
"Amazing atmosphere. There are a lot of space between the machines and there are sufficient showers for females that I have never queued for. Love that the staff do not disturb us or try to upsell packages. They will check you in at the counter and you are free to get on with your stuff. Even for goers who only came for the trial, they won't be made to feel obligated into joining the gym.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,390,2019
Recommended. Does it get any better? Anywhere? Doubt it...,5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,58,2019
"Never enough glasses and cups, seems under resourced",3,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,52,2019

"Rules for the sake of rules. And expensive. Apparently, you HAVE to do the class warm up EXACTLY as prescribed when doing a class. Lol. You cannot, even if you remarkably know your own body better than them, do your own stretches. Big brother knows best. We have rules? Why? Cause its the rule. Note this is not a written down policy (naturally as its rather unenforceable) just something they make up because they have to feel important for themselves. Given like any gym you are rightly asked to sign a waiver form, this isnt about injury liability this is just about the instructors and staff decreeing power amongst themselves and then feeling self important when they address and enforce their own rules. For the money and total lack of common sense i would strongly recommend another gym.",1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,794,2019
"Smaller than most of the other Virgin Singapore outlets, but love coming here for the altitude room!",4,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,100,2019
"Great gym, especially for international travelers with premier memberships. The gym offers so much space and variety of exercise types. The dedicated deadlift area was definitely a plus. The free gym gear and towels are a must. Just wish the weight area was a little bigger to match the rest of the gym.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,303,2019
"A wonderfully clean and well maintained gym in posh surroundings. Plenty of equipment, modern and spacious.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,107,2019
"Sparkling upscale gym with top notch facilities and equipment. Unfortunately it is only accessible via one lift and a few times it went out of service and the patrons have to take a long detour from the office building to get in. Also the floor shakes too much, cant bear running on a treadmill as the footsteps of the neighboring runner causes the floor to recoil back, affecting my stride and perhaps too much impact on my knees.",3,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,431,2019

Top top-notch gym with great view and super clean facilities. Worth the membership price,5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,88,2018
"I really loved their Grid Active Classes and a fan of Bodystep sessions every wednesday. However they rely on Sofitel for swimming activities. I would recommend this club for the ambience, good service and group workout sessions.",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,229,2018
"One thing that I really love about Virgin Active is that they do NOT hard sell! They did not push me to sign any contracts, and they have a flexible option for the fickle-minded. The gym is well-equipped, with great instructors and staff. Locker & shower area is kept clean, with pretty good quality toiletries (only thing I need to bring to the gym is my skin care products). Worth checking out if you're looking to join a gym in Singapore!",5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,441,2018
Posh! But entrance lift is a bit tricky to find,5,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,47,2018

"Bad experience for my scheduled tour. Arrived on time and inform the receptionist but told to wait at the lounge. After 30 minutes of waiting, nobody approached me so I followed up with the receptionist. Receptionist asked one of the staff to walk me around the workout area. Tour was less than 2 minutes. Nobody explained to me about the delay or about the gym.",1,Virgin Active,Tanjong Pagar,362,2017
