"This club doesnt even deserve one star rating ,the gym didnt revamp or upgraded I dun see cleaner sanitised the equipment or machine ,look at market street cleaners more active n they do clean up sanitised every 30 mins to ome hours , treadmill machine got sweaty marks n cleaner does not bother to clean up and wrost still next morning still have one of the wrost fitness first branch I had visited. Terrible",1,Fitness First,Junction 10,409,2024
"I joined the centre last Oct. Staff here are really friendly. I'm a regular of Tuesday boom class and the trainer, Ansafuddin (Danny) is always so passionate and helpful to guide us through. A big thumbs up for him!",4,Fitness First,Junction 10,215,2024
"Despite all sorts of brand names and competitive prices were popping out, Fitness First Junction 10 had been my home club for a couple of years.

If you visit other gyms, you will realize that Fitness First has a uniformity in full standards across most branches. And their locations are always very accessible.

Facilities are holistic from cardio, to machines, free weights and even a functional zone for your Hyrox Prep. Operating hours are not 24/7. But it is very convenient for me.

I have no intention of changing gyms for now. I hope the organization will cherish their loyal customers.",4,Fitness First,Junction 10,594,2024
Good selection of free weights and machines. Bigger than it looks from the outside.,5,Fitness First,Junction 10,83,2024

My trainer provides personalised guidance and that keeps me motivated and on track with my goals. Fafa is very approachable and helpful, making every visit welcoming!",5,Fitness First,Junction 10,293,2024
"Junction 10 used to have many great and strong instructors like Joe , Pierre, Gary, Louis, Magesh, Joleen and more. They have grown together with the students. Now the best of the best were asked to leave without a reason.

Classes like viper, bosu , circuit,
Animal flow, sprint , total body conditioning , bodyattack and lesmil core are removed too. These classes are mainly replaced by pump, combat and zumba. Feedback to management but was ignored.

No good trainers. No variety classes. Maybe is time for us to move on too. Government 365 app classes are free and they have more to offer. BTW 1 star is for front desk staff n cleaners. Thanks for all these yrs hardwork.",1,Fitness First,Junction 10,675,2024

"Always been a passionate rpm rider at J10. To see great instructors being removed out of the blue is worrying. First we lost Joe, now to hear Pierre not having anymore classes makes me question where the group fitness spirit going? Theyve been an incredible and amazing instructors who always have so much crowd. I cant seem to understand why popular and well loved instructors who make so many ppl see the magic in rpm seem so easily replaceable.",2,Fitness First,Junction 10,447,2024

"When I made my first inquiry about the classes in Fitness First Junction 10, Kenny, the consultant, promptly reached out and he is helpful in getting a trial class for me and showed me around the gym. He was clear in explaining the facilities, classes and membership plans. He is also very responsive when I have questions or need any help. Thank you, Kenny!

I also would like to thank my personal trainer, Ahmad, for his great expertise and guidance, my fitness level has improved and I feel much stronger than before.

I highly recommend him to anyone seeking guidance and support in their fitness goals.",5,Fitness First,Junction 10,402,2024
"Had the chance to meet Kenny during my first visit and learned a lot about FF from him - body scan machine, studio classes, amenities, fitness equipment. He listened to my goals and advised a few membership plans for me to consider. I like how he is really enthusiastic and passionate about fitness and his work. He never fails to smile and say hi to everyone he knows in the gym! Do look for him if youre still on a lookout for gym memberships.

I took up a 4mth plan to test waters but ended up upgrading to a 12mth plan because i enjoy heading down to have me-time! Also had the privilege to sign up for PT with Desmond - it was great learning from him.

However J10 isnt my preferred outlet as it is only a Premium outlet, without certain benefits (provision of outfits, infused water) which i think is quite important to me. In terms of facilities, Westgate is better.",5,Fitness First,Junction 10,873,2024

"Unlike Fitness First platinum like in metropolis. This club does not provide with any attire. Only towels are given. So definitely over priced than other gyms.
Considering the limitation of space this club has, it is extremely crowded in the evening. The staff is rude. One day a staff member who was not even wearing Fitness first attire told me that he is a supervisor and started telling me about the fitness first policy. When I approached the front desk, they had no clue.. this guy followed me to the front desk and started arguing with me. I just left..
I am a member of FF since long time and I am regular patron on Metropolis gym.. never had such a rude experience.",1,Fitness First,Junction 10,674,2024

Overall a great gym to workout in",5,Fitness First,Junction 10,349,2023

(they help me whenever I have difficulty with my floor workouts and also they give tips to make it better; they don't mind sharing their knowledge despite me not being under PT)  that's a vibe you'd always want to have in a gym! They've been so accomodating of my queries/needs at the gym. Candies? (Wanting to faint cause of your workout? Syazlin got you! Hehe) Hair Tie?  Punching gloves?? (Oh my this is so embarrassing but there was one time when Fafa lent me her boxing gloves just so I can attend my Boom class) They even get out of their way to answer my queries even on their off days, thanks Fafa! I notice that they always engage with the members whenever they can, checking up on how you're doing, how come you haven't been to the gym for awhile and what not.

"Awesome gym that I visit regularly.

Great service from staff, clean and well maintained facilities, wide range of equipment although slightly old, never too crowded. Nice gym crowd with varying levels of experience.

Only gripe is that it can get warm at times in the toilets and weightlifting area, due to the building structure that makes it hard to retain cold air (they do provide a big fan). Sometimes you may also smell the Sheng Shiong located beneath the gym, as they probably share the same vents.

Compound lifts equipment available:
1 flat bench press rack
1 incline bench press rack
1 half rack
1 full rack with attached platform
1 smith machine",5,Fitness First,Junction 10,658,2022

"Coming from True Fitness whereby we had to fight for lockers during peak hours that does not even work sometimes (fellow gym members who are rushing to change to attend a class will understand my frustration), joining Fitness First was the best decision i ever made in 2021. My home club is Junction 10, and everything was right from day 1 - with your super friendly and efficient consultant Fafa who attended to my enquiry patiently and explain the t&c very clearly. Fitness First is blessed to have such a dedicated sales staff! From the second day onwards the counter staffs call me by my name - these are small things but it goes a long way on how dedicated FF Junction 10 is to provide the best workout experience and customer service!

"Joined FF Junction 10 for 4yrs.
Great place to workout, along with friendly staffs.
Enjoy attending classes till I suffered severe knee pain. I was fortunate to met my current PT, Danny who noticed my knee problem after one of the FGT class .
After a few non-obligations session with him, there has been tremendous improvement on my knees and that's where I decided to took up a 24 session with Danny followed by a 72 session.

I have witnessed great progress with personal strength & fitness and I strongly recommend him (Danny)to anyone who wish to excel in your personal fitness.",5,Fitness First,Junction 10,582,2022
"1. Terrible training experience with personal trainer nicknamed Danny who was unhappy that I signed up for only 8 sessions. I had ab strain after training with him and left a lengthy google review but it was hidden.  No tracking of progression of weights lifted.

The sales manager who manages this Google page, is no better as he claimed that injuries would only occur after 48 hours with Danny so it could have been the group FF classes that I joined . Ok can. I only used 7 out of 8 PT sessions.

Left negative feedback on the FF junction 10 FB page and was blocked. Wow.

2. Classes have been reduced since pandemic and are fully booked. Hard to get slots
Anyway I cancelled my membership after this training fiasco.

Update:
Gave 2 star rating instead of 1 because the Front desk staff are nice, patient and friendly.",2,Fitness First,Junction 10,822,2022

"I took personalised one on one supervised basic fighting and body strength sessions and it was really worth it. I highly recommend it. I trained under the supervision of Jake, my coach/trainer. My sessions were planned to my body strength and limits, neither too much nor too little. Jake, as a coach was very encouraging, highly motivating and very supportive. He has all the qualities of a good coach. In each session, I was trained to my limits, with proper posture and Jake behind my back encouraging and supporting all the time.
All in all it was a great experience and totally worth it. The superb coach was one of the reasons that really stood out.",5,Fitness First,Junction 10,655,2022
"FF J10 is almost like my second home. Staffs are nice and they do remember members by name which is pretty amazing.

I am fortunate to have 2 PTs ( though not at the same time ). The first trainer is Audy who set the foundation of my stamina and strength. He never fail to stun me with his workout. He is also some one with a big heart who will still correct me on my movements even if it is not the training session with him.

The 2nd trainer, Tony is encouraging and patient in guiding me through the various exercises and the many questions that I always have. Tony level up my strength to another upper level.

Highly recommend those who want to keep fit like me to join Fitness First Junction10.

All staffs at Junction10 are very friendly & helpful,
especially Aaron Tok, very professional & helpful in assisting any queries when approached. When I have doubt on the boditrax apps, Aaron made efforts to explain & guided me through.

And my personal trainer, Jake Tan, who is very patient & motivational when doing PT. Jake will modify the training to suit my age & fitness level. Even when I am not having PT session, when approach, Jake will explain how to use the various equipments in a very helpful way.
I have gained lots of confidence & able to train independently, largely due to the staffs friendliness & professionalism they perform.
Kudos to you guys. Keep up the good work.

ive seen some improvements since my first time here a year ago. they replaced all plates and bars for classes, provided more equipment etc. class size can be improved as i noticed that thursday evening classes are always extremely packed to the point where there is not enough space to maneuver.

the greatest disappointment will be my consultant, Joy (probably not from J10), who disappeared almost immediately after i signed up for the membership. needed help in suspension of the membership and texted her to no avail. i guess it is fair to say some consultants (not all) only exist when you have something to offer.",2,Fitness First,Junction 10,817,2019

They also advertise on their website a Fitpass with a fixed term access (1 week, 2 weeks, ...) without a commitment but in reality the messaging is gradually changed and by the time of the payment its a pass for 1, 2 ... classes within a 1, 2 ... week period.

Then when I went to the mens locker room to get protein powder, I saw some staff gathered around me. What were we discussing in front of the sauna? There was a lot of water on the ground. It turned out that there was a fire in the sauna. I seemed to have heard the alarm ringing just now. I was still wondering what the ringing meant. Maybe it was the smoke that set off the alarm. When I finished exercising and took a shower, I wanted to use the sauna.

"Service recovery from both Fitness First George Street and Member Experience executive Rose has been abysmal and honestly really disappointing.

I submitted a membership termination request at the front desk of OGS in October 2023 and was notified that I had to serve a notice period of one month (November). As I already had travel plans and had no intentions to use the gym in Nov, I checked with the front desk staff if I could serve notice while my membership was on freeze. To which he said I could and proceeded to put my account on freeze for Nov.

Fast forward 1st December, I was notified that my card was charged the regular monthly fee for my supposedly terminated membership. Hence I called in (5 Dec) to the membership experience team and was attended by Rose, to which I learnt that there was no termination request put in as you cant have your account on freeze while on your notice period.

I explained that I had been wrongly informed of this since if I already had intentions to terminate my membership and I knew of this, how would putting my account on freeze make any sense at all? She then tells me shell investigate with the club and will get back to me in 2-3 business days.

It is now past Christmas and I have received zero follow ups from Rose and have had to make multiple calls back to her every few days to check back on the status. Not too sure if this is the customer experience Fitness First is going for......",1,Fitness First,One George Street,1443,2024

"I have been with FF for more than 10 years. My monthly payment is on auto payment/Giro on every 1st of the month. Never failed to make payment on time. I recently lost my wallet and had to replace my credit card and relink the auto payment. I arrived at the club on the 2 Oct, the staff informed me they did not manage to get my monthly payment on the 1 Oct from my lost credit card. I immediately paid the fee for Oct. And asked the staff to relink to my new credit card. She did and I gave her the OTP code to complete the transaction.

I was able to get to the gym subsequently (Tues, Wed)

On Thursday, I received an email from the office that they did not get my Oct payment and failed to deduct from my credit card. Hence my membership is suspended. I explained that I did make Oct payment and the new credit card was provided. She checked and confirmed they received the payment but I need to relink my credit card to reinstate my membership.

Why???? Oct payment was made and I should be able to link my credit card or choose to pay cash etc on a monthly basis. I should not be forced to link my credit card!

An hour later, another staff from ORQ club called me to inform me that my payment was not received....I repeated the whole story again.

I went to the club on Friday, and they in fact suspended my membership.

Till now, I have emailed the managers of the club and FF. No one is able to explain to me why they suspended my membership when I had made the payment.

I am not sure if the management has changed over the years.... everything from hygiene of the shower room to equipments are going down hill..... especially OGS club. And now they are behaving like cowboys....",1,Fitness First,One George Street,1689,2023

"Went to tour this gym location before deciding whether to purchase membership and assign this location as my home gym. I was there on a Saturday afternoon. Met with a consultant and he give us a brief tour (5 mins). Unfortunately he was busy and had to attend to another client and told us he could answer our questions after he was done. We roamed around the gym on our own. The gym is definitely one of the smaller ones in terms of size within the Premium FF network. I went during non peak and there was quite a number of people working out. Non of the chairs & tablets were available in the pool area. I have to give a special shout out to Clement at the front desk. He was very helpful and informative. Was very patient and answered all my questions with a jovial attitude. Great attitude and personality! I would have been sold if he was the membership consultant

"This is one of the smaller platinum outlets for Fitness First. The price point is higher than average, but so is the service that you'll experience.

The gym is small, but it is not usually overcrowded during lunch, which leads to quicker workouts and showers. There's a lot of treadmill machines that are underused; most of the activity is concentrated in the free weights area.

The counter staff are always on hand to cater to your needs. One of them personally helped me search the gym and locker rooms when I misplaced my card. The women's locker rooms have also just been upgraded with quality rain showers.

The pool holds stunning views during sunset; whether you're soaking in the water, lounging on the reclining deck chairs or dozing off in the hammocks.

I'd give this outlet a perfect 5 stars if it were open on weekend nights.",4,Fitness First,One George Street,840,2019

"Wanted to give this gym a chance. Just as expected, more than disappointing. Adding my negative review as a complement read to the others who negatively reviewed the gym environment and equipment (to which I wholeheartedly agree as well).

I wonder if FF staff are actually deliberately inattentive to those on (free) trials, because the experience I got was abysmal.

Counter staff was curt through and through. Is she stressed out or did FF hire any one willing to take up a job? Although I was new, no orientation was done, just flippant random finger pointing of where locations might be. Was passed the locker card which I did not know how to use and was not told how to. Had to wait for a random gym user to pass through the female toilet to ask her.

I was there to experience a group class. I specifically told the sales rep (Edmund) that I wanted to try Bodypump. Made no effort to help secure that class although he knew it was popular. Got the class after that, which was Bodybalance. Sales rep was also not there to facilitate the process.

Instructor did not bother to orientate or brief class participants about equipment setup, just assumed everyone would know or figure out, despite there being more than one newbie. Me, being a guest, did not know about this cryptic chope-ing rule of mats, 2 ladies complained about me to the instructor when I took one of their mats, and he did nothing to ameliorate the situation. I offered to switch but the butch-looking one told me to ""forget it"". What a horrid encounter before the class even started. Not only the staff, but the members were equally hostile.

Despite relating all these to the sales rep via WhatsApp, all he could do was to say sorry. No customer/service recovery whatsoever, even when I said I would not sign with FF. What a lazy sales rep.

Don't bother signing with FF. Don't think they even need more clients since the sales rep did nothing to try to secure a deal, and staff on-site did nothing to make the experience pleasant.

There are a ton of other places that offer Les Mills and better instructors. Don't waste your time here.

"Terrible experience at Fitness First Paya Lebar!

The personal training session with Jasper Chin was unprofessional--he was overly touchy. For example, during a lower back exercise, I did not do the exercise correctly and he slapped the area near my hip and laughed about it. I was shocked and uncomfortable with his behaviour. During another exercise, he made an inappropriate comment about my waist, saying that people with small waists would dote on their future partners. There were also times when he made dismissive comments, saying that some girls are overly sensitive--which felt like a form of gaslighting.

He also kept pushing the training package while insisting he wasnt earning a commission, and even sent photos of famous people, claiming he had trained them. His actions and comments made me feel extremely uncomfortable, and I did not pay a premium price for such unprofessional service!

As someone signing up for a personal trainer for the first time, I was not informed about my option to choose a trainer. The salesperson assigned me a trainer without asking for my preference, which further added to the unprofessionalism! I hope Fitness First Paya Lebar will make this option clear to all their clients, including whether they prefer a female or male trainer.

Additionally, personal trainers should maintain professionalism and avoid sending irrelevant content. It would have been more appropriate for the trainer to send a text to schedule/reschedule the PT session instead of making repeated phone calls, which I found unprofessional and intrusive...",1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,1576,2024

I went in yesterday to check if I had dropped my VIP membership card on Monday.
His tone attitude was not only pleasant, but also in a helpful customer oriented manner which I appreciated very much.

Although initially he could not understand what I meant by a ""VIP membership card"", he used his initiative to run through the generic cards from his drawer to help bridge a common understanding of what I was referring to.

He went on to verify my membership, when I was last issued with a physical card and the years I've been with Fitness First to qualify for the issuance of the card.

I've employed many service staff in my company and I'm impressed by his performance. He has displayed professional attitude, initiative, grace and knowledge as an FOH. One of the best once in my memory as a member for the past 20 years.",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,905,2024

"My experience with the gym was average (the start off 3 sessions at Paya Lebar outlet -.-')
I won't encourage anyone to trial for the 3 kickoff PT. Nothing much to take away unless you take notes  ..
Pros:
1) Paya Lebar front desk staffs are usually quite friendly. There are few and especially Angela*. She has been always very friendly, warm, helpful throughout my experience whenever I come in.
2) Gym and shower locker is clean
3) convenient locations. Not too crowded.
4) Some Classes instructors are nice.
5) workouts attire provided (convenient)",3,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,552,2024

"My friend recommended me to fittness first to exercise on 16 Nov, thats was my 1st experience to gym also was 1st time visit to gym is fittness first, my friend advised me not to wear watch n rings during workout so i took out my 2 diamond rings and digital wach put into shorts pocket that belongs to gym, after 1 hr workout I went to shower, I forgotten to take out my belongings, only very night after 10pm I realised my rings was not at fingers i asked my friend to ring the outlet staffs , he told me branch already closed but he texted branch colleague to look out on this matter. After 2 days the caller told him only the watch has been found not the rings. I twisted my waist after 2-3 days later, 3weeks later on 28 Nov I went to paya lebar fittness first to collect my watch , the counter Indian lady call kanchu claim herself as in charge of the branch so I told her the incident of my case and is a memorable gifts, she promised n said she will definitely call me on very day to update me on my case, I keep waiting for her call yet not a single call rrceive from her, I keep thinking is this how fittness first in charge handle customers?? I decided to call up paya lebar fittness first for a check out on my items, then call bound to call center , lady told me shes a counter girl not in charge and when call transfer to the branch, she pick up, I ask her do she remember me that day I came down to collect my watch n ask on my lost rings under lost n found? She ans YES, I asked her, promised to call me on the very day on my lost n found items and make me waited more than a week for your call, she replied me she MC for 1 week and told me she pass my case to her colleague on next day, I asked her are you MC on that very day that you promised me?
Firstly, how can a counter girl claim herself as in charge?
Secondly, empty promise to customers
End up let me feel that not professional
and bad impression of fittness first service that I unable to forget",1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,1971,2023

"Ive had an excellent experience at this fitness center. The gym is clean and spacious, with a wide variety of equipment, including free weights and weight machines. There are also a lot of group fitness classes offered, so theres something for everyone.

Im especially happy with my personal trainer, Alvin. I have signed up 35 PT sessions with him in total. Alvin is extremely approachable, makes me feel comfortable, corrects my form, selects appropriate weights and exercises tailored to my needs. He offers guidance on executing movements correctly and instructs me on the usage of various equipment. Hes exceptionally patient and even takes notes to monitor progress.

I highly recommend this Fitness First location to anyone looking to improve their fitness journey!",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,773,2023

"Absolutely lousy service. The few times I went to this outlet, the staff were not friendly - this, I wouldn't complain about on its own. But, what's frustrating is their attitude and service when I reported my lost card.

I went on 15 August and checked in in the morning. After my session, I reported that I lost my card and think I left it in the exercise shorts, which I placed in the laundry. The staff immediately said there is no lost card - if there were, they would've been alerted by the cleaner already. I said I JUST left the toilet 10min ago, so the cleaner may not have cleared the laundry since then. I told the staff I've to rush off but please call me in 2-3 hours to update me about the status of my card.

The staff gave assurance that whether or not they find it, they will call me to let me know. But on the same day, more than 2-3 hours later (**this would be around 5pm**), they still had not called me.

I called Paya Lebar outlet to check on the status of my card. They said they already took down my name and will call me if they find it. By the next day, they still had not called me.

I then called FF and someone on the line said they've reported my request directly to Paya Lebar's outlet and the staff will call me. Still, no call.

2 weeks have passed and I haven't received a call from the Paya Lebar staff. I went to a different outlet to ask for a check on my card. The staff at the other outlet told me there were TWO check-ins on my card at the Paya Lebar outlet on 15 August. **One was around 5.30pm** Meaning, either the staff found my card and checked-in for whatever reason, or someone else used my card at the same outlet and the staff just let the person in. Moreover, the staff did not inform me about this when I called them around 5+pm that same day, and instead told me my card still hasn't been found.

What were the Paya Lebar staff doing? They said they had taken down my name and card number and would be on alert... why did they not pick up on this and not call me the entire time? Either the staff are irresponsible, negligent, or dishonest?

The staff from the other outlet said he will inform Paya Lebar to call me. One day later, still no call.

I would say I'm speechless about the lousy service but in reality I've too much to say. Unacceptable lol",1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,2305,2023

He is very friendly, not intimidating, adjust my posture and will choose weights and routine that suit me. He gives tips how to execute movements properly and teaches me how to use different kinds of equipment. He is someone very patient, even writes down notes to keep track of what you've done.

Although sometimes I feel that she is a devil, but as long as I dont give up and finish what she teaches, I will feel my body is no longer the same as usual.I only trained with her for 1month,I can feel that my body strength has increased, my body is lighter and I feel more energetic.

Hafiz is a trainer who leads by example and displays high consistency. He himself trains really hard in his free time and maintains a great physique, which serves an inspiration. For my program, he emphasizes on compound exercises with progressive overload and good form, which helps a lot in gaining overall muscularity and strength over the last 1 year.

With her help, I've gained strength and muscles, and can clearly see a difference from the first session I had with her. She always pushes me to my limit and motivates me throughout my sets not to give up.

Special mention for my first and official Personal Trainer EK. I have been to fitness first since start of 2021, hoping to have more firm and good looking figure.

"The gym has awesome facilities and I only need to bring my shoes which is extremely convenient for my day-to-day busy schedule.

My trainer EK is one of my First PT that I have engaged and I am extremely Impressed. One of the main reasons why I have engaged a PT is due to the lack of discipline. Being Overweight. getting started is definitely a challenge that I face. She always pushes me past my limits and I didnt even realized that I crossed my previous heaviest weights that I could lift.

Only after one month of training, Ive received feedback from my peers that they can finally see a hint of my chin. (Due to my double chin hehe)

Definitely look for EK if you want to keep fit, get strong and stay healthy.",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,717,2022

"I am a member. The facility is also beautiful.
The environment differs depending on the store, and I think the main features of PayaLebar are that it has a relatively large selection of weight machines compared to other FitnessFirst stores, has a boxing area, and is open even on Sundays.

For me, the advantage is that its located in a shopping mall in front of the station, that there are multiple shopping malls adjacent to it, and that its convenient for shopping and eating after returning from the gym.

Fitness First in the business district where I usually go is often closed on Sundays and public holidays, so I use it when I want to go on Sundays.
*You will need a special pass to visit any store.

There is no pool.
The shower is attached to the ceiling rather than the wall, which is a negative point for me as I like to wash my face and head separately.",4,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,866,2022

For the paid trial session, I bought the 3 session package 40mins each. My trainer Wind asked to combined the session into 2, so 2 times 60mins lesson.
However, I only received 2 times 50mins training as trainer said my body couldn't afford for 60mins. I asked it should be better to keep 3 times 40mins per session instead? The reply was 40mins not enough, and never mentioned about the shortage of 20mins.

"Trial experience was very disappointing, especially for a gym franchise that is supposed to be premium in terms of service and space.

Referral staff was not around when I signed in which caused some confusion with receptionists about whether or not I could use my trial pass on the day, and almost got turned away.

Overall, staff didn't feel welcoming or friendly, and were quite pushy in terms of sales as well. The minute I said I'll think about it and listed my factors for consideration - crowds, space, equipment variety, location - she tried to guilt-trip me by saying I ""will not reaching my fitness goals by making excuses for myself"", although these are valid pointers for consideration? What a turn-off if you're trying to get someone to sign up for your gym!

Facilities wise, as others have pointed out, 75% of the area was used for group classes and it was very crowded. Equipment and machine range not as wide in variety as other gyms, even the smaller ones.

Likely won't be coming back - disappointing experience.",1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,1031,2020

"Have been a member for a few years. Have always just ignored the bad policies from the management but the most recent incident really annoyed me. I just switched my payment mode from credit card to giro. I was told it would take 4-6 weeks to activate and during the transition period, I would have to make a manual payment at the counter when I visit the gym. But on 2nd April I received a call from Geena Kaur asking for my CARD NUMBER and expiry date. I was shocked! I told her I was not comfortable in giving such details over the phone and as I was intending to head down to the gym later in the evening, I told her i would make payment at the counter. But she INSISTED I give it to her over the phone.

When you first sign up, they tell you that you can freeze your membership anytime and the fee can be pro-rated if you need to freeze it for less than a month. When I wanted to freeze my membership for the last 2 weeks of the month, I was told it could not be done. Reason given was that they can only freeze a minimum of a whole month starting from the beginning of the month and the pro-rating was if i cut the freeze before the month ended. Which means if I have to travel, i can only travel after the first week of the month if I want to get it freezed it or get it pro-rated which is absolutely ridiculous.

The counter staffs and trainers were all really nice and friendly, but the management and management staffs are really bad.",1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,1443,2019

Been there for my training on Sunday morning. Quite compare with the peak hours rush 6pm-8pm. Friendly staff and place walking distant from MRT station. There are Giant and NTUC nearby. Easy for shopping after a hearty workout.,4,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,227,2018
Great for the boxing and muay thai enthusiasts as there are so many heavy and water bags. There is a nice choice of flavour infused waters as well.,5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,147,2018
"Excellent range of equipment, impressed with the range of bodyweight training stations, which include rope climbs, monkey bars and punching bags.

Resistance/free weights area is good, didn't notice an assisted pull-up/dip station or Smith machine. This Area will feel cramped when busy, but during off-peak times the proximity of the machines is actually quite convenient.

My only small gripes are the limited number of cable attachments. The classes are loud but I train with music and this doesn't bother me. Would be frustrating for someone wanting to use the bodyweight training areas whilst there are classes using them, suggest checking the class schedules before planning your training times.

Charging station around the refreshments area is very handy too.",4,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,767,2018
Nope.,1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,5,2018
"very noisy gym ,because of open Concept so you heard different music playing at the same time and the trainer Keep Shouting with the mic you will become deaf one day.....",1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,170,2018
"Very horrible design and concept.
The staff excused it as open gym concept. But it does explain these:

Very tiny lifting area.
Very tiny changing room.
Gym close at 10pm then start from 9:30pm stop serving beverage.
Arrived at 7pm twice, both times run out of towels.

It literally the worst fitness first club Ive been",1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,320,2018
Loud classes conducted side by side without defined work out spaces. Weights are cramped to a corner. Not a conductive environment for a good workout. If I were in one of the classes I would feel very self conscious with the whole gym looking at us and distracted by other programs going on. Gym amenities are clean and the cucumber/lemon water is a nice touch.,2,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,361,2018
"As others have said, a disappointment. Large gym area totally occupied by group classes. Very small and cramped weight area, have to squeeze between machines. Only one squat rack so constant queues. Very small number of plates, and no 1.5kg. Looks fancy but other locations have more equipment. Not sure what FF were thinking",2,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,325,2018
"Changing cabinets got no separation for shoes. Mysteriously inconsiderate design can be found from many else's.

Tiny spaces for weight, unnecessarily huge space for classes. I have used many FF branches but this is definitely one of the worst.",1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,244,2018
"big dissapointment for this outlet, doesnt even have some basic machine such as Smith machine, time to cancel my membership to go back to cheaper option with better range of equipment",1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,183,2018
"Terrible outlet to be honest. Feels too gimmicky, you guys have such a huge area, but in reality, the functional usage is just 1/5 of it all. Everything in the changing rooms scream cheapskate and cutting corners on quality and functionality.",2,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,242,2018
"Easy access to my work at Tai Seng Area, really pretty for IG worthy photos.",3,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,76,2018
"Great new location with convenient parking and public transport access. Have a few things I need to point out:-
1) for some inexplicable reason they did away with the little cubby hole in the locker meant for your shoes...
2) its a very small space, of which more than half is probably for group exercise areas, leaving your regular weights/machines/cardio activities squished in a really small area
3) on the plus side, changing and shower areas are really clean! *probably just because it's new*
4) the general workout areas... feel very dusty. Or is that just me",3,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,565,2018
New outlet of fitness first. Equipments and facilities are new . Could have been better if there is a pool and if the classes areas are enclosed to block out the noises.,3,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,169,2018
Biggest disappointment of a gym. Only one squat/power rack and tiny free weight area with 80% of the gym dedicated to class space and punching bags for boot camps. Only two weight trees so you spend the majority of your time searching for plates to use and only a couple of benches in the dumbell space as well. The gym was made to look good on Instagram and not actually be a good gym.,1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,386,2018
"Located at Singpost Centre at Paya Lebar, this is excellent for people staying in the east of the island, especially in the Bedok and Marine Parade area. It has not opened yet though, it is only going to open sometime in June 2018. Very nearby to the Paya Lebar MRT and bus stops.",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,280,2018
