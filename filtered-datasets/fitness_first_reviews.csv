"This isn't the place to go if youre considering AF or a new gym. The vibe here is tense, and the staff can come across as overly authoritative. If you're looking for a more relaxed and positive environment, I'd recommend the central branch instead. It's not worth spending the extra money at this outlet, especially when the personal trainers seem unprofessional and disrespectful. You'd be better off finding a regular gym that offers better service and saves you money.",1,Fitness First,Tampines,471,2024
"closing time is extended compare to last time. this is more flexible to members. well done! for those staff that are aggressive i saw the comments, not all of them. maybe they are tired also. but all in all they are accomodating and friendly. sometimes we have to be more understanding and choose to be kind.",5,Fitness First,Tampines,308,2024
Luv the ambience and the equipment here.,5,Fitness First,Tampines,40,2024
"My recent visit to Fitness First was marred by lackluster customer service from the front desk staff and aggressive sales tactics from the sales team. The receptionist appeared disinterested, providing vague responses to my queries. The sales team resorted to high-pressure tactics, pushing for a quick decision without clear information. The gym environment felt more like a sales pitch than a welcoming fitness center. Overall, the experience was disappointing, with a focus on closing deals rather than prioritizing customer satisfaction. I left feeling uncomfortable and unlikely to return.",3,Fitness First,Tampines,594,2024
This branch does not provide gym attire. Do bring your own clothes.,4,Fitness First,Tampines,67,2024
"I gving 5* due to the staff working there, they are friendly and willing to help if you have queries. But let me tell you this: the place is small and crowded. If you wish to do your sets or reps, prepare some of them will hog the equipment until theres no tomorrow.",5,Fitness First,Tampines,266,2024
Great gym with good equipments and good customer service too,5,Fitness First,Tampines,60,2024
Hua Guan has been an amazing trainer and I dare say that I recommend anyone to look for him if you are looking to achieve your own personal fitness goals. He has been with me at every step of the way be it fitness or nutrition to make sure I am hitting my goals one step at a time; finetuning workouts to make sure sessions are not rigid and switching up meals so you do not have to stick to mundane meals all the time. I would give him 6 stars but too bad google review only allow 5 as the max.,5,Fitness First,Tampines,495,2023
"This outlet of Fitness First is one of the more spacious ones! Theres a good selection of machines, and there are 3 power racks! Which is great because I hate queuing for the barbell, plus I dont feel so pressured to finish my sets. This outlet doesnt offer workout attire though, and only towels. But for a gym in the hood and not in town, this is pretty well equipped.",5,Fitness First,Tampines,370,2023
Amazing environment and well equipped ,5,Fitness First,Tampines,38,2023
"Join ff because of the polite staff but tampinese ff is opposite. Not only the staff is rude the management there also very rude. Hold back my cash card and not let me leave saying that I cannot bring visitor even if they give me the 3day pass for my friend, we have to wait 10min for the management to come out and warn me that I have to pay 35dollars if I didnt informed inadvance, this is the 2nd day I use the pass and first day already meet the staff with all explanation of the place at tampinese so I thought 2nd visit no need book again. I apologise and say ok nxt round I will book before I bring a friend with the 3day pass as I was given 3 passes but the staff insist of holding me back to finish all her talks, I suggest if want to do all this maybe can give a call and not holding me and my guest and also taking my cash card and not returning is really not right. After this case the staff that hold back my card would give me a fercie look whenever I use the gym in tampinese ff. Hope some changes can be done in tampinese ff. When to others ff and never had this problem before.",1,Fitness First,Tampines,1094,2023

Mentioned online as open when in fact the gym is closed for the holiday. Saw a couple of others being turned away by the building security. Utter waste of travel time as a result of misinformation,1,Fitness First,Tampines,196,2023
"Wanted to get a one day trial of the place and forgot that i had like signed up for the trial la. Didnt go, and the lady called me a day after and kinda asked ""whats the purpose of you going for the trial ah?"" Sounded more like she didnt wanna let me go and just wanted to get ppl to immediately pay for it. LOL. Such a money grabber. I told her i am unemployed atm and also just wanted to try the gym but its ok sounds like this gym has issues anywayyy. Oh and i asked her ""sorry? "" cause i couldnt hear her and she just said thank u and put down the phone.... Erm sure?",1,Fitness First,Tampines,571,2023

Worst experience,1,Fitness First,Tampines,16,2023
"Good facilities with large cardio and strength area, large clean bathrooms and showers, and class studios. I only took 1 star away because the membership fees and sign up process were annoying.

First you have to meet a salesperson before theyll tell you the fees, and second you must pay an initiation fee which is the worst part of gym memberships.

The salesperson said to waive the initiation fee, I will have to sign up for personal training sessions and nutritional supplements. I chose that but the personal trainer assigned to me had a very bad attitude. I told him Id trained before (with my fiance) and he mocked my form. 2 years? Youve trained for 2 years and you still cant do a deadlift properly? Very annoying. Didnt try to make another appointment with him.

Classes are difficult to book unless you camp at your phone. I dont think I will sign up with Fitness First again.",4,Fitness First,Tampines,888,2023
"One of the front desk lady has disgusting service attitude. I went to the gym and politely asked to claim a guest pass for my bf (as per the new rules) and she was seemingly annoyed by my request, raised her voice, demanded to know who my fitness consultant is and kept pressing me to contact my fitness consultant. She basically tried to push all her responsibility away. What a shame to meet a service staff that lacks basic courtesy. Also, facility is dirty. Equipments are often dusty (especially the plates), yoga studio smelled like sweaty feet the whole time, and there were even cockroaches in the shower. Imagine paying over $160 for standards worse than public gym. Needless to say I discontinued my membership. Please avoid at all costs.",1,Fitness First,Tampines,748,2023
No pantry and no attire supply,3,Fitness First,Tampines,30,2022
"Pre-covid, I was with FF for more than 15 years. Then rejoined in 2022. Noticed the Yoga instructors' standards dropped , left only few good ones like Faiz , Chandra , Paul but they only teach 1-2 times a week. Rest of the instructors especially Albert Tan, Christine Tan classes are disappointing! You would not want to waste your time.
Feedback a few times to the club , hopefully will see improvements.",1,Fitness First,Tampines,405,2022
"I tend to attend their yoga classes - can be hit or miss depending on who's the instructor.
Very disappointed with yoga class by Albert Tan, he basically just used the opportunity to showcase his advance yoga skills
Its not a class to show what he can do it should be a class to teach how to do different poses but he ended up skipping the basic and demo the advance poses.
Another occasion one friday lunch time i was the only member for Christine Tan class and she just asked if I had anything that i need to concentrate on and showed me a few poses then winded up the class in 15 minutes. I did not go all the way to attend a 15 minutes class.
Good yoga instructors that i hope will continue teaching are Ian Fung, Faiz, Dawn Tan and a few more.",2,Fitness First,Tampines,748,2022
"Just yesterday, a fitness instructor with no trace of training pointed at my face, stared at me and said some very, very rude words to me because I occupied his stool and returned it. I was very scared at the time, I went to the bar to ask for help. It was 7:30 in the evening. I went to the bar to find a solution. The two beauties at the bar told me that all the people in charge were off work at that time. Then the reply to me was that there was no one, and the two of them gave me a smile that no one would care about if you complained. At this time, the fitness instructor with no trace of training came over again, stared at me, and pointed at me, as if to say If there is anything rude, it may be because many people are watching. The coach was very excited and made a  gesture towards me. Since he is not good at quarreling in crowded places, you win the customer, but you lose. The influence of the company, and many people nearby saw the performance of the fitness instructor. Will having such employees have a good impact on your company? Is this the professional quality of a fitness instructor that a high-end gym in Singapore should possess? Please conduct self-examination within your company.",1,Fitness First,Tampines,1209,2022
"Getting lousier and lousier in service standards.
PT will rush other gym users to allow their trainees to use their machines....
Pay a bit more.. and you can use the premium services of pure fitness...
Consider jumping ship?
Have been a member for 5 years and fitness first is slowly degrading itself from a premium club to one that is on par with neighbour hood gyms.. feel sad!",1,Fitness First,Tampines,379,2022
"I have been a member for the past 4 months. I took the first month to assess the place and the people in it to make sure I am comfortable training there. The consultants, Johann and En En, are very friendly and patient in answering all my queries.
As I am entering my 50s, I took up the gym membership with specific goals in mind. I was recommended Herman to be my personal trainer. I am grateful that he is able to create a training programme to help me achieve my goals, without being too hard on me but yet still keep it challenging. He checks on me every time to make sure I am ok before and after my session. 4 months on, I have made considerable progress which motivates me to train regularly at the gym.
The gym is spacious and well-equipped. It has a big locker room and lounge area on the second floor. The toilet and shower rooms are kept clean always. The equipments are clean and well-maintained. I do not join the classes and I am not pressured to sign up for any, which is good.
Overall, I am comfortable there. If theres a room for improvement, it is to install a bidet in the toilet cubicles.",5,Fitness First,Tampines,1108,2022

"I first visited fitness first way back, before covid happen. And I was amazed by the space and the design of it. Really feel comfortable working out there.
Now I have already sign a package with them, which Im really glad.
Their service staff are really friendly.
The gym instructors too..
Many lockers.
There a sauna and steam room too.

And best of all. Is located near tampines mrt station",5,Fitness First,Tampines,392,2022
"Trainers need to walk the ground to supervise and monitor users. There's a bald Chinese guy at the free weights area who moves the bench to the dumbbell rack and hangs both his legs up on the dumbbell rack for whatever reason. ???Unsafe and very inconsiderate to other users who want to use the dumbbells but no staff says anything. He ""owns"" the gym apparently. Talks loudly and acts cool. Annoying.",1,Fitness First,Tampines,400,2022
Aged facilities but Overall is good,5,Fitness First,Tampines,35,2022
Highly not recommended ! Paying premium membership fee for non premium facilities. Facilities are old and poorly maintained. Poor booking system which are difficult to book workout time slot. Gym penalised members even with valid reasons.,1,Fitness First,Tampines,238,2021
"I started personal training with Herman in June 2020. Herman starts training session with a well-being check to ensure I am well from injuries and recovery from previous training. At Fitness First Tampines, the Boditrax machine is available so we do have access to our muscle and fat % and other details. Herman tracks our trainings through a shared online form that we both can monitor that includes the above details. Slightly a year ago, I started training feeling 18kg kettlebell deadlift was challenging and now through training I am at 55kg barbell deadlift and hopefully to grow stronger.

One of the bigger branch in Singapore. The downside is that they do not provide clothing and there is no swimming pool like the one in Jurong and Ang Mo Kio.,4,Fitness First,Tampines,157,2020
"This is a very big branch as compared to the others I've went (West Gate, 100AM, Changi Biz Hub, Paya Lebar & AMK Hub).

Compared to them, this has also the biggest resting lounge area. The toilet and lounge and dance studio is on the second level while the rest of the gym is on the first.

The many treadmills had window view and TVs of international channels. (Westgate only has a pool view but no TV. Changi Biz hub had tv but the view outside the window was nothing much, AMK hub is basement so they only had TV, Paya Lebar only has window view and 100AM has no TV)

On top of that I feel that this Tampines branch has mainly every possible equipments which other branches lack. Kudos.",5,Fitness First,Tampines,690,2019

"Despite all sorts of brand names and competitive prices were popping out, Fitness First Junction 10 had been my home club for a couple of years.

Facilities are holistic from cardio, to machines, free weights and even a functional zone for your Hyrox Prep. Operating hours are not 24/7. But it is very convenient for me.

Animal flow, sprint , total body conditioning , bodyattack and lesmil core are removed too. These classes are mainly replaced by pump, combat and zumba. Feedback to management but was ignored.

"When I made my first inquiry about the classes in Fitness First Junction 10, Kenny, the consultant, promptly reached out and he is helpful in getting a trial class for me and showed me around the gym. He was clear in explaining the facilities, classes and membership plans. He is also very responsive when I have questions or need any help. Thank you, Kenny!

I also would like to thank my personal trainer, Ahmad, for his great expertise and guidance, my fitness level has improved and I feel much stronger than before. Ahmad has been patient and encouraging in explaining and guiding me through the different workouts. He is also very attentive to details, safety and injury prevention, emphasising proper form and techniques to prevent any injuries.

"Kenny at the J10 branch of Fitness First has been an incredible consultant for all my membership matters.

I highly recommend him to anyone seeking guidance and support in their fitness goals.",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,402,2024
"Had the chance to meet Kenny during my first visit and learned a lot about FF from him - body scan machine, studio classes, amenities, fitness equipment. He listened to my goals and advised a few membership plans for me to consider. I like how he is really enthusiastic and passionate about fitness and his work. He never fails to smile and say hi to everyone he knows in the gym! Do look for him if youre still on a lookout for gym memberships.

I took up a 4mth plan to test waters but ended up upgrading to a 12mth plan because i enjoy heading down to have me-time! Also had the privilege to sign up for PT with Desmond - it was great learning from him.

However J10 isnt my preferred outlet as it is only a Premium outlet, without certain benefits (provision of outfits, infused water) which i think is quite important to me. In terms of facilities, Westgate is better.",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,873,2024

"Unlike Fitness First platinum like in metropolis. This club does not provide with any attire. Only towels are given. So definitely over priced than other gyms.
Considering the limitation of space this club has, it is extremely crowded in the evening. The staff is rude. One day a staff member who was not even wearing Fitness first attire told me that he is a supervisor and started telling me about the fitness first policy. When I approached the front desk, they had no clue.. this guy followed me to the front desk and started arguing with me. I just left..
I am a member of FF since long time and I am regular patron on Metropolis gym.. never had such a rude experience.",1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,674,2024

(they help me whenever I have difficulty with my floor workouts and also they give tips to make it better; they don't mind sharing their knowledge despite me not being under PT)  that's a vibe you'd always want to have in a gym! They've been so accomodating of my queries/needs at the gym. Candies? (Wanting to faint cause of your workout? Syazlin got you! Hehe) Hair Tie?  Punching gloves?? (Oh my this is so embarrassing but there was one time when Fafa lent me her boxing gloves just so I can attend my Boom class) They even get out of their way to answer my queries even on their off days, thanks Fafa! I notice that they always engage with the members whenever they can, checking up on how you're doing, how come you haven't been to the gym for awhile and what not.

"Awesome gym that I visit regularly.

Great service from staff, clean and well maintained facilities, wide range of equipment although slightly old, never too crowded. Nice gym crowd with varying levels of experience.

Only gripe is that it can get warm at times in the toilets and weightlifting area, due to the building structure that makes it hard to retain cold air (they do provide a big fan). Sometimes you may also smell the Sheng Shiong located beneath the gym, as they probably share the same vents.

Compound lifts equipment available:
1 flat bench press rack
1 incline bench press rack
1 half rack
1 full rack with attached platform
1 smith machine",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,658,2022

"Coming from True Fitness whereby we had to fight for lockers during peak hours that does not even work sometimes (fellow gym members who are rushing to change to attend a class will understand my frustration), joining Fitness First was the best decision i ever made in 2021. My home club is Junction 10, and everything was right from day 1 - with your super friendly and efficient consultant Fafa who attended to my enquiry patiently and explain the t&c very clearly. Fitness First is blessed to have such a dedicated sales staff!

"Joined FF Junction 10 for 4yrs.
Great place to workout, along with friendly staffs.
Enjoy attending classes till I suffered severe knee pain. I was fortunate to met my current PT, Danny who noticed my knee problem after one of the FGT class .
After a few non-obligations session with him, there has been tremendous improvement on my knees and that's where I decided to took up a 24 session with Danny followed by a 72 session.

I have witnessed great progress with personal strength & fitness and I strongly recommend him (Danny)to anyone who wish to excel in your personal fitness.",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,582,2022
"1. Terrible training experience with personal trainer nicknamed Danny who was unhappy that I signed up for only 8 sessions. I had ab strain after training with him and left a lengthy google review but it was hidden.  No tracking of progression of weights lifted.

The sales manager who manages this Google page, is no better as he claimed that injuries would only occur after 48 hours with Danny so it could have been the group FF classes that I joined . Ok can. I only used 7 out of 8 PT sessions.

Left negative feedback on the FF junction 10 FB page and was blocked. Wow.

2. Classes have been reduced since pandemic and are fully booked. Hard to get slots
Anyway I cancelled my membership after this training fiasco.

Gave 2 star rating instead of 1 because the Front desk staff are nice, patient and friendly.",2,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,822,2022

He has all the qualities of a good coach. In each session, I was trained to my limits, with proper posture and Jake behind my back encouraging and supporting all the time.
All in all it was a great experience and totally worth it. The superb coach was one of the reasons that really stood out.",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,655,2022

I am fortunate to have 2 PTs ( though not at the same time ). The first trainer is Audy who set the foundation of my stamina and strength. He never fail to stun me with his workout. He is also some one with a big heart who will still correct me on my movements even if it is not the training session with him.

The 2nd trainer, Tony is encouraging and patient in guiding me through the various exercises and the many questions that I always have. Tony level up my strength to another upper level.

ive seen some improvements since my first time here a year ago. they replaced all plates and bars for classes, provided more equipment etc. class size can be improved as i noticed that thursday evening classes are always extremely packed to the point where there is not enough space to maneuver.

the greatest disappointment will be my consultant, Joy (probably not from J10), who disappeared almost immediately after i signed up for the membership. needed help in suspension of the membership and texted her to no avail. i guess it is fair to say some consultants (not all) only exist when you have something to offer.",2,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,817,2019

"Wanted to give this gym a chance. Just as expected, more than disappointing. Adding my negative review as a complement read to the others who negatively reviewed the gym environment and equipment (to which I wholeheartedly agree as well).

I wonder if FF staff are actually deliberately inattentive to those on (free) trials, because the experience I got was abysmal.

Counter staff was curt through and through. Is she stressed out or did FF hire any one willing to take up a job? Although I was new, no orientation was done, just flippant random finger pointing of where locations might be. Was passed the locker card which I did not know how to use and was not told how to. Had to wait for a random gym user to pass through the female toilet to ask her.

I was there to experience a group class. I specifically told the sales rep (Edmund) that I wanted to try Bodypump. Made no effort to help secure that class although he knew it was popular. Got the class after that, which was Bodybalance. Sales rep was also not there to facilitate the process.

Instructor did not bother to orientate or brief class participants about equipment setup, just assumed everyone would know or figure out, despite there being more than one newbie. Me, being a guest, did not know about this cryptic chope-ing rule of mats, 2 ladies complained about me to the instructor when I took one of their mats, and he did nothing to ameliorate the situation. I offered to switch but the butch-looking one told me to ""forget it"". What a horrid encounter before the class even started. Not only the staff, but the members were equally hostile.

Despite relating all these to the sales rep via WhatsApp, all he could do was to say sorry. No customer/service recovery whatsoever, even when I said I would not sign with FF. What a lazy sales rep.

Don't bother signing with FF. Don't think they even need more clients since the sales rep did nothing to try to secure a deal, and staff on-site did nothing to make the experience pleasant.

There are a ton of other places that offer Les Mills and better instructors. Don't waste your time here.

"Terrible experience at Fitness First Paya Lebar!

The personal training session with Jasper Chin was unprofessional--he was overly touchy. For example, during a lower back exercise, I did not do the exercise correctly and he slapped the area near my hip and laughed about it. I was shocked and uncomfortable with his behaviour. During another exercise, he made an inappropriate comment about my waist, saying that people with small waists would dote on their future partners. There were also times when he made dismissive comments, saying that some girls are overly sensitive--which felt like a form of gaslighting.

He also kept pushing the training package while insisting he wasnt earning a commission, and even sent photos of famous people, claiming he had trained them. His actions and comments made me feel extremely uncomfortable, and I did not pay a premium price for such unprofessional service!

As someone signing up for a personal trainer for the first time, I was not informed about my option to choose a trainer. The salesperson assigned me a trainer without asking for my preference, which further added to the unprofessionalism! I hope Fitness First Paya Lebar will make this option clear to all their clients, including whether they prefer a female or male trainer.

Additionally, personal trainers should maintain professionalism and avoid sending irrelevant content. It would have been more appropriate for the trainer to send a text to schedule/reschedule the PT session instead of making repeated phone calls, which I found unprofessional and intrusive...",1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,1576,2024

I went in yesterday to check if I had dropped my VIP membership card on Monday.
His tone attitude was not only pleasant, but also in a helpful customer oriented manner which I appreciated very much.

Although initially he could not understand what I meant by a ""VIP membership card"", he used his initiative to run through the generic cards from his drawer to help bridge a common understanding of what I was referring to.

He went on to verify my membership, when I was last issued with a physical card and the years I've been with Fitness First to qualify for the issuance of the card.

I've employed many service staff in my company and I'm impressed by his performance. He has displayed professional attitude, initiative, grace and knowledge as an FOH. One of the best once in my memory as a member for the past 20 years.",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,905,2024

"Absolutely lousy service. The few times I went to this outlet, the staff were not friendly - this, I wouldn't complain about on its own. But, what's frustrating is their attitude and service when I reported my lost card.

I went on 15 August and checked in in the morning. After my session, I reported that I lost my card and think I left it in the exercise shorts, which I placed in the laundry. The staff immediately said there is no lost card - if there were, they would've been alerted by the cleaner already. I said I JUST left the toilet 10min ago, so the cleaner may not have cleared the laundry since then. I told the staff I've to rush off but please call me in 2-3 hours to update me about the status of my card.

The staff gave assurance that whether or not they find it, they will call me to let me know. But on the same day, more than 2-3 hours later (**this would be around 5pm**), they still had not called me.

I called Paya Lebar outlet to check on the status of my card. They said they already took down my name and will call me if they find it. By the next day, they still had not called me.

I then called FF and someone on the line said they've reported my request directly to Paya Lebar's outlet and the staff will call me. Still, no call.

2 weeks have passed and I haven't received a call from the Paya Lebar staff. I went to a different outlet to ask for a check on my card. The staff at the other outlet told me there were TWO check-ins on my card at the Paya Lebar outlet on 15 August. **One was around 5.30pm** Meaning, either the staff found my card and checked-in for whatever reason, or someone else used my card at the same outlet and the staff just let the person in. Moreover, the staff did not inform me about this when I called them around 5+pm that same day, and instead told me my card still hasn't been found.

What were the Paya Lebar staff doing? They said they had taken down my name and card number and would be on alert... why did they not pick up on this and not call me the entire time? Either the staff are irresponsible, negligent, or dishonest?

The staff from the other outlet said he will inform Paya Lebar to call me. One day later, still no call.

If you are the type who is a gym beginner, wants someone welcoming, patient to start slow and improve gradually, then you can look for Alvin as your personal trainer.",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,645,2023
"Hands down, best choice I've made after moving to Singapore is to join Fitness first and train under Alvin Tan. He is a very friendly guy and he makes sure he created PT plan keeping my goals in mind and he always there to support me but also challenge me to push higher, i will definitely recommend to train under Alvin and yes the staff is also very friendly and supportive make me actually want to go train everyday, Thanks Alvin and Team Fitness first",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,455,2023
My PT Alvin Tan provide me some beneficial tips.His class were customized for me.Each class was different. Very friendly staff and encouring personal trainers. Good experience,5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,175,2023

Gym was fantastic.,5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,18,2023

"Edmund was helpful in booking a trial class for me and explaining to me about the membership. Tried out their bodycombat class and it was great. The trainer, Kelvin, had a great ton of energy and the class was fun and tiring. The gym is huge and the facilities are good. They provide towel and attires if you ever need one. The shower area also provide shower essentials, hair dryer or even deordorant etc. Overall, it's a great gym facility.",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,442,2023
"I have been with my coach yeekay for the past couple of months, she has been a great support to my fitness journey. I have weak knees. She would always check up on how Im feeling if its hurting. We would always stop immediately and switch to alternative doable exercise when I felt pain. She help guided me throughout my workout, gave me better tips on better execution and engagement on the workout.

The gym facilities, the space, equipments and shower rooms are well equipped. I highly recommended this place and coach yeekay who want to try pt.",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,548,2023

Staff during weekend is very lazy. No one at the reception.,1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,59,2023
"The equipments are amazing. The trainers are very approachable and assist you in the best possible way. I had a personal trainer and she was very dedicated in towards her work. She ensures you reach your goals in the given time you have set for yourself. She also would understand your schedule and plan your training accordingly. This gives you flexibility and motivates you.

Clean and hygienic atmosphere.",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,408,2023
"I didnt know how to do it when I first started working out, so I got pt from Yee kay. She worked together for my goal and taught me detailed exercise methods.",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,158,2023
"I started going to FF since Jan 23, my PT Yee Kay is very friendly and helpful. She taught me the correct form of exercises and has been very patient with me as I seems to have some minor health issue, she helps to research for me and gave me tips on diet and also taught me the correct breathing techniques. Within this short 1 over month, I have learnt so much from her and can see that my muscles are more defined. Definitely will recommend her to anyone who is interested in engaging a PT.",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,493,2023
"Yeekay is a very good trainer, she taught me the knowledge of exercise and how to lose weight correctly. Every session, she will ask me to improve and always remind me the correct posture. She was very confident and enthusiastic about to my improvement. And she would guide and motivate me through the process the moment I wanted to give up. Although sometimes I feel that she is a devil, but as long as I dont give up and finish what she teaches, I will feel my body is no longer the same as usual.I only trained with her for 1month,I can feel that my body strength has increased, my body is lighter and I feel more energetic. I highly recommend choosing her and Fitness First Payalebar to anyone looking to change their lifestyle and fitness level. Thanks to the team for a great experience.",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,793,2023
"I have been training with Hafiz for more than a year. I used to be quite scrawny and have since then made significant progress on my physique and sometimes received compliments! Hafiz is a trainer who leads by example and displays high consistency. He himself trains really hard in his free time and maintains a great physique, which serves an inspiration. For my program, he emphasizes on compound exercises with progressive overload and good form, which helps a lot in gaining overall muscularity and strength over the last 1 year. Overall, I would recommend Hafiz for anyone who is looking for a trainer to uplift their fitness or physique.",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,643,2023
Great place to workout,5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,22,2023
I would like to compliment one of the staff at FF SingPost - Nurul. She is very friendly and helpful. Good job!,5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,111,2023
"Signed up for personal training sessions with Yeekay as I was not sure I'm confident enough to go to the gym alone at first. Her teaching is really good and workouts are never boring with her.

With her help, I've gained strength and muscles, and can clearly see a difference from the first session I had with her. She always pushes me to my limit and motivates me throughout my sets not to give up.

Overall I feel a lot more better and I can't wait to continue my journey with Yeekay and Fitness First - Definitely recommend!

Gym facilities are great too ",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,558,2023
"Ive been able to learn the right workouts and form thanks to my trainer EK. I feel confident while making my progression to higher weights, knowing that I have been taught the basics correctly.

I like the gym overall as its well maintained and always full of activities.",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,271,2023
"I only sign three months membership with them, but they still keep charging after the term ends without any notice. Very unpleasant experience with them. Be very careful with them when you sign contract with them.",1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,213,2023
Vending machine took my money but didn't dispense. Staff refused to help me get the drink or refund me but asked me to call the vending machine's company instead.,1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,162,2023
"Love how spacious it is! The outlet is relatively new. So, the equipment and the overall aesthetic look is still pretty brand new. What got me really excited was the shower area! It was refreshing to see a well-maintained (kind of brand new!) fittings and the full works! Dont miss out!",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,286,2023
"Yeekay is a good trainer compare to my previous trainer in FF j10, she taught me insightful knowledge and push me to my limit whereas my previous trainer never does. She is very confident and enthusiastic about my improvement and progress, doing gym session with her is very fun. She always guided and motivated me throughout my set the moment I want to give up. I'm much improved person, my body strength has increased compared to the first session I had with her. I would highly recommend her and fitness first Payalebar gym club to anyone looking to transform their lifestyle and fitness level. Thanks to the team for the amazing experience.",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,644,2022

"Kudos to the team and staffs at Fitness First Paya Lebar for the awesome and friendly service provided.
Special mention for my first and official Personal Trainer EK. I have been to fitness first since start of 2021, hoping to have more firm and good looking figure. However I'm lack of the knowledge and in these areas etc what is the correct posture for different workouts. EK patiently guided me and taught me! Look forward to greater heights with her! Reach out to her for better body figure~ ",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,497,2022
"The gym has awesome facilities and I only need to bring my shoes which is extremely convenient for my day-to-day busy schedule.

My trainer EK is one of my First PT that I have engaged and I am extremely Impressed. One of the main reasons why I have engaged a PT is due to the lack of discipline. Being Overweight. getting started is definitely a challenge that I face. She always pushes me past my limits and I didnt even realized that I crossed my previous heaviest weights that I could lift.

Only after one month of training, Ive received feedback from my peers that they can finally see a hint of my chin. (Due to my double chin hehe)

Definitely look for EK if you want to keep fit, get strong and stay healthy.",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,717,2022
"Before starting personal training here I couldn't do a proper squat and could only do so many before my legs got tired. After starting personal training with Yeekay for slightly more than a month, my legs have become stronger and can do more squats in a row as well as a variety of exercises. Yeekay is friendly and motivating and fast at correcting my form. Great guidance and easy to follow for people new to the gym",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,418,2022
"Great space and classes for your prefer workout. With all the proper equipment and punching bag. They also have a small steam room. Best of all, no need to bring work out gear, towel or bathing utility. All is provided. Love this place. Coffee tea water is available for consumption. All rounded place for work out, relax before hitting back to work.",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,350,2022
"Feels more posh than the other outlets. But space is limited, therefore feels crowded during peak hours. Has boxing lessons.",4,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,124,2022
"I am a member. The facility is also beautiful.
The environment differs depending on the store, and I think the main features of PayaLebar are that it has a relatively large selection of weight machines compared to other FitnessFirst stores, has a boxing area, and is open even on Sundays.

For me, the advantage is that its located in a shopping mall in front of the station, that there are multiple shopping malls adjacent to it, and that its convenient for shopping and eating after returning from the gym.

Fitness First in the business district where I usually go is often closed on Sundays and public holidays, so I use it when I want to go on Sundays.
*You will need a special pass to visit any store.

There is no pool.
The shower is attached to the ceiling rather than the wall, which is a negative point for me as I like to wash my face and head separately.",4,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,866,2022
Horrible staff at the reception. When a cleaner accidentally throw my mask away at the locket . I asked the for disposable mask . They want charge for it . VERY MONEY MINDSET. Very disappointed with the services. Specially during covid a lot have cut cost and giving out a disposable mask would want to charge. Very disappointing as a member of FF,1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,347,2022
"Dated cardo equipment. Staff very interested in talking to each other, not so interested in being helpful. Other FF gyms maybe a better option.",2,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,143,2022
Very friendly staff and great place to exercise. Love it. It has a very family vibes.,5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,85,2022
"Good service, and good facilities there, what can be improved is utilising the space well because its a bit cramped in there but kinda cosy and convenient for east side people of SG. There are other FF outlets, but this is just one of them for east siders and like wanting a compact space to do gym workouts.",4,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,308,2022
"Disappointed personal training. I was told to run on my own for 30mins for the free trial session.
For the paid trial session, I bought the 3 session package 40mins each. My trainer Wind asked to combined the session into 2, so 2 times 60mins lesson.
However, I only received 2 times 50mins training as trainer said my body couldn't afford for 60mins. I asked it should be better to keep 3 times 40mins per session instead? The reply was 40mins not enough, and never mentioned about the shortage of 20mins.

And it would be great if he could reduce the usage of phone during the training session.",1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,596,2021

"I see there are a lot of good reviews from local guides.....to me after seeing a lot of gyms, this is one of the most depressing Ive ever seen. For 200 dollars youre in a cubicle with even the group classes in the same room, annoying you as you run on a thread mill. Locker rooms are Outdated, classes are mwah, staff is not caring.

Great place to workout. One of the newest Fitness First outlets. Group exercise is conducted in an open space concept. Might get a little too crowded during peak hours. Showers are pretty new and clean. The changing rooms have limited locker spaces due to the human capacity restrictions in place due to COVID-19.,5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,313,2020

"Trial experience was very disappointing, especially for a gym franchise that is supposed to be premium in terms of service and space.

Referral staff was not around when I signed in which caused some confusion with receptionists about whether or not I could use my trial pass on the day, and almost got turned away.

Overall, staff didn't feel welcoming or friendly, and were quite pushy in terms of sales as well. The minute I said I'll think about it and listed my factors for consideration - crowds, space, equipment variety, location - she tried to guilt-trip me by saying I ""will not reaching my fitness goals by making excuses for myself"", although these are valid pointers for consideration? What a turn-off if you're trying to get someone to sign up for your gym!

Facilities wise, as others have pointed out, 75% of the area was used for group classes and it was very crowded. Equipment and machine range not as wide in variety as other gyms, even the smaller ones.

Likely won't be coming back - disappointing experience.",1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,1031,2020
"Large new outlet work lots of equipment. Rogue power rack, Eleiko platforms/bumper plates/platform. Theres also an additional octagonal cage like structure with 2 additional racks.

"Possibly your worst outlet ever - where is the individual changing room that all your other outlets have?

Small and overcrowded, similar to community centre type of gyms. Will not be back again and glad I do not live in the vicinity. That said, good job on all other other outlets except this one.",1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,298,2019
Lovely gym.. good atmosphere.,5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,29,2019
"Have been a member for a few years. Have always just ignored the bad policies from the management but the most recent incident really annoyed me. I just switched my payment mode from credit card to giro. I was told it would take 4-6 weeks to activate and during the transition period, I would have to make a manual payment at the counter when I visit the gym. But on 2nd April I received a call from Geena Kaur asking for my CARD NUMBER and expiry date. I was shocked! I told her I was not comfortable in giving such details over the phone and as I was intending to head down to the gym later in the evening, I told her i would make payment at the counter. But she INSISTED I give it to her over the phone.

When you first sign up, they tell you that you can freeze your membership anytime and the fee can be pro-rated if you need to freeze it for less than a month. When I wanted to freeze my membership for the last 2 weeks of the month, I was told it could not be done. Reason given was that they can only freeze a minimum of a whole month starting from the beginning of the month and the pro-rating was if i cut the freeze before the month ended. Which means if I have to travel, i can only travel after the first week of the month if I want to get it freezed it or get it pro-rated which is absolutely ridiculous.

The counter staffs and trainers were all really nice and friendly, but the management and management staffs are really bad.",1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,1443,2019

"When I signed up for a 12-month contract, the agent lied to me that I will be getting a 50% promotional discount for my first month fee. I was shocked FFP Paya Lebar charged me the first fee at full amount. What a scam!",1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,219,2019
"they requested to hold my IC for locker key. When i said i will not give it, they proposed to trial without locker. what a stupid guess?

btw, from what I saw - smallest FF i ever seen, but still quite functional (mote for marrial art, but not for weight training tho)

definitely not for that money they are asking for it.",1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,323,2019

Been there for my training on Sunday morning. Quite compare with the peak hours rush 6pm-8pm. Friendly staff and place walking distant from MRT station. There are Giant and NTUC nearby. Easy for shopping after a hearty workout.,4,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,227,2018
Great for the boxing and muay thai enthusiasts as there are so many heavy and water bags. There is a nice choice of flavour infused waters as well.,5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,147,2018
"Excellent range of equipment, impressed with the range of bodyweight training stations, which include rope climbs, monkey bars and punching bags.

Resistance/free weights area is good, didn't notice an assisted pull-up/dip station or Smith machine. This Area will feel cramped when busy, but during off-peak times the proximity of the machines is actually quite convenient.

My only small gripes are the limited number of cable attachments. The classes are loud but I train with music and this doesn't bother me. Would be frustrating for someone wanting to use the bodyweight training areas whilst there are classes using them, suggest checking the class schedules before planning your training times.

Charging station around the refreshments area is very handy too.",4,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,767,2018

"Very horrible design and concept.
The staff excused it as open gym concept. But it does explain these:

Very tiny lifting area.
Very tiny changing room.
Gym close at 10pm then start from 9:30pm stop serving beverage.
Arrived at 7pm twice, both times run out of towels.

It literally the worst fitness first club Ive been",1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,320,2018
Loud classes conducted side by side without defined work out spaces. Weights are cramped to a corner. Not a conductive environment for a good workout. If I were in one of the classes I would feel very self conscious with the whole gym looking at us and distracted by other programs going on. Gym amenities are clean and the cucumber/lemon water is a nice touch.,2,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,361,2018
"As others have said, a disappointment. Large gym area totally occupied by group classes. Very small and cramped weight area, have to squeeze between machines. Only one squat rack so constant queues. Very small number of plates, and no 1.5kg. Looks fancy but other locations have more equipment. Not sure what FF were thinking",2,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,325,2018
"Changing cabinets got no separation for shoes. Mysteriously inconsiderate design can be found from many else's.

Tiny spaces for weight, unnecessarily huge space for classes. I have used many FF branches but this is definitely one of the worst.",1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,244,2018
"big dissapointment for this outlet, doesnt even have some basic machine such as Smith machine, time to cancel my membership to go back to cheaper option with better range of equipment",1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,183,2018

"Easy access to my work at Tai Seng Area, really pretty for IG worthy photos.",3,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,76,2018
"Great new location with convenient parking and public transport access. Have a few things I need to point out:-
1) for some inexplicable reason they did away with the little cubby hole in the locker meant for your shoes...
2) its a very small space, of which more than half is probably for group exercise areas, leaving your regular weights/machines/cardio activities squished in a really small area
3) on the plus side, changing and shower areas are really clean! *probably just because it's new*
4) the general workout areas... feel very dusty. Or is that just me",3,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,565,2018
New outlet of fitness first. Equipments and facilities are new . Could have been better if there is a pool and if the classes areas are enclosed to block out the noises.,3,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,169,2018
Biggest disappointment of a gym. Only one squat/power rack and tiny free weight area with 80% of the gym dedicated to class space and punching bags for boot camps. Only two weight trees so you spend the majority of your time searching for plates to use and only a couple of benches in the dumbell space as well. The gym was made to look good on Instagram and not actually be a good gym.,1,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,386,2018
"Located at Singpost Centre at Paya Lebar, this is excellent for people staying in the east of the island, especially in the Bedok and Marine Parade area. It has not opened yet though, it is only going to open sometime in June 2018. Very nearby to the Paya Lebar MRT and bus stops.",5,Fitness First,Paya Lebar,280,2018
