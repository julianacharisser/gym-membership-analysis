Staff members very friendly and always Welcomed us and greeted us with a big smile (really unlike the other outlets like Marina one). The gym floor is spacious and nice and my favourite reformer pilates class is by Fay. The best pilates instructor so far. Very experienced and guided us very well unlike other instructors who just give verbal cues and not help u fix your form etc.

Improvements:
- However I think the showers have to be improved. The flooding in the female toilets is quite disgusting.
- The shampoo and conditioner is also quite damaging to my hair. Considering the amount we pay I think it'll be good to invest in better quality shampoo and conditioners.
- Sometimes the towels are pretty nasty with some stains on them and they look very used.
- The VA membership has some discounts but it's very limited and not appealing. As someone who comes on the weekends for gym, discount partnerships with the restaurants like Rappu and featherblade are unavailable from Fri-sun. Which is quite sad... also the restaurant Goho has been closed for many months now. Please update the discount list and would like to suggest to bring in other trendier places. 10% discount is quite sad honestly. Suggestions to partner with acai affair/summer acai/more salad places/sbcd house or any other eateries nearby. Can also partner with like activewear brands like gymshark/alphalete/csb/lululemon. Or other local brands. Suggestions to bring in discount for bulk protein bars or protein powder purchases etc",a week ago,2024-12-10T14:50:20,,,,0,1,,,,

The Club at Tanjong Pagar is poorly managed.

Cleanliness of the male shower room is disgusting.

The scheduling of the cleaner in the changing and shower area is always at peak hours.

They often (9 out of 10 times) run out of L size attire and socks during weekdays before 11 am their scheduled delivery time for next batch of clothing.

The cold plunge is down for at least 2 weeks.

I don't normally do Pilates but I have noticed that in this outlet the sheer amount of reformer beds in one setting isn't enough for 1 instructor. Unless all the attendees are seasoned Pilates goers.

They have many non official certified Pilates instructors too which sometimes translate to interesting classes...

Her tone was aggressive, and she expressed anger over my decision not to join the gym due to unfriendly staff--something my friend also experienced.

Furthermore, during our conversation, she shouted at me, stating that she let me in despite me being one minute late. In reality, she informed me that latecomers were not allowed to join the class, and she merely observed me attempting to enter from a distance. My friend was also denied entry due to being 10 minute late. While it is reasonable to not allow latecomers to enter, it should be conveyed to the customers clearly and the staff in VA did not manage to do that. There was no mention of any grace period nor any rules about late comers, even after my friend message them to inform that she would be late.

However, I did not regret joining VA membership after having experienced a wonderful service provided by the whole Tanjong Pagar team over the past two months here.

FOH:
I recalled dropping by on a late afternoon of Vesak Day to make an enquiry on what VA has to offer. I was immediately greeted by the pleasant team member as soon as I stepped out of the lift and was asked how I can be assisted. Having understand my enquiry, she had me seated while she paged for an available relationship consultant to meet up with me.

While waiting for my consultant, I took notice of the FOH checking in processes on a peak day. One word: SEAMLESS!

Within 15 seconds the whole check-in process was completed. While the member approach the first team member for check-in, the other 2 team members were already preparing the locker keys and workout attires. An additional person was on standby to assist any time to ease the waiting time where needed.

Im rather impressed at the level of meticulous planning the FOH manager must have taken into consideration in ensuring that the members get what they needed fast to start their session even during the peak-hours.

RELATIONSHIP CONSULTANT:
I was later greeted by Kishen my consultant. Really great welcoming personality and instantly connect on a personal level being able to understand my concerns, needs and past experiences I had with other brand clubs.

I was given a guided gym tour and explained what this studio has to offer in terms of facilities and equipments and spaces. Kishen also took the time to share the available packages based on my fitness needs and clarify any doubts I have regarding to the billing cycle and T&Cs.

FACILITIES:
The male locker room is very spacious, with an impressive minimum of 20 shower cubicles and over 200 lockers. The locker room has great ventilation system, and they have a locker room attendant readily on duty in ensuring the locker is well-maintained.

However, I do feel that the common corridor of the shower area could be better maintained, as it would get rather slippery during peak hours. I also felt that the maintenance of the lockers could be done a lot better, as the locks tend to be rather faulty. It gets really frustrating and I could occasionally hear other members frustrations too.

PERSONAL TRAINER:
I was quickly connected with my PT, Samuel, the following day after having signed up with VA and scheduled our one-time complimentary PT session.

Through our first session, I could sense the passion and enthusiasm Samuel has as a very young PT. He took genuine interests on assisting me in attaining my fitness goals, by asking many relevant questions, such as my past fitness experiences, dieting, working schedules and both short-term and long-term goals I hope to achieve.

After our first complimentary session, without hesitation I took up the 3-months training program with Samuel when he introduced the various PT packages offered by the club.

Over the past 2 months, with Samuels clear explanation and easy-to-follow exercises & training programs, I find myself easily attune to the training planned by him. With each PT session meet-up, Samuel will always make our training challenge, yet fun and enriching at the same time by introducing new exercise routines and machines to keep me engaged.

The one biggest wishlist that I would like to ask for, is to probably have an integrated program into the VLocker App; for the PTs and Trainees to track their individual training programs, and performances. This is to have a clearer visibility like how we can track our bills and bookings of classes.

Lastly, I would like to take this opportunity to show my heart-felt appreciation for Sameul and every one in the club; including the class facilitators, in making my fitness journey at VA a warm-welcoming and friendly place to be at. Great job!",5 months ago,2024-07-17T14:50:20,"Hi Daniel,

instead of performing their duties to clarify with me that the billing date for May is on the 2nd instead of 7th, (which was a different debit date in March, which then i had to also freeze my account), i received a reply that my account would be frozen from ""2nd to 12 June 2024"", no word of 'May' was mentioned.

i replied this morning saying they got the dates wrong, because i realised my account was still active.

(btw in this email reply of yours ""2nd to 12 June 2024"", for anyone with an understanding as to how a person types/writes date would see that it was meant '2nd of June until 12th of June.')

now the rep is here telling me i should provide my flight ticket to help adjust the billing process, this was after telling me blatantly in the previous emails that they wouldn't be able to do a backdate on my request since the billing date for May was actually 2nd of May instead of 7th of May.

However, I'm displeased with the service rendered. It's a world class gym with everything except a simple microwave for guests to use.
I carry my meal prep with me and it's really unpleasant to eat it cold after a workout. Have written in to suggest adding a microwave but no follow ups. On a few occasions, trainers and even a consultant told me that I can request the counter staff to help me heat it up when they are not busy (off peak hours).
Today I took the chance to ask the counter staff to help me heat up my lunch at 2.30pm ( there were many staff at the counter and no guests coming in and out) Instead, I was rejected by them and they said that the microwave is only for staff.
Why the double standards when the trainers (at least 3 of them have told me it's ok) and consultant have told me that the counter staff have helped others do it. Really unsatisfied and disappointed with the service.",7 months ago,2024-05-17T14:50:22,"Dear Karize Kieu,

Ive been training with Iqmal frequently, and I cant recommend him highly enough! He is incredibly knowledgeable, motivating, and supportive. Thanks to his personalized workouts and guidance, Ive seen amazing progress in my fitness goals.

However, regarding Virgin Active (VA), I must express dissatisfaction. The facilities and class standards leave much to be desired, with equipment having broken leather seats, making it uncomfortable to use. With the departure of experienced instructors, the quality of classes has declined significantly. Additionally, Ive encountered frequent instances of double charging, and the refund process is excessively cumbersome and protracted.

I made appointment online prior to meeting her at the gym to show me around. Once she saw me she said: oh i never thought you would look like this. I said: what do you mean? She said: oh nevermind. After she showed around i agreed to try the trial class. In the conversation she mentioned the gym is more targeting on the expats hence the gym implement biweekly payment. Been asking her to send me a whatsapp of the pricing etc. Never send to me until i asked again (how stupid i was) and she just brushed me off: oh i never send you is it? 
Long story short i decided not to come back and she ended up whatsapp me to check on the status.

Rudy has consistently exceeded my anticipations by demonstrating exceptional insight into monitoring my physical activities, vo2 max, and simultaneously providing mental stimulation through humor during our sessions. His sessions have always been characterized by a pleasant blend of productivity and light-heartedness, which I have found to be highly enjoyable.

5/5 for my personal trainer Thapelo
He helped me get in shape for my wedding in a short span of time (2 months) and was very adaptive with my workout plan during and after my wedding
I got to know of his services when I approached him for some questions on my workout plan and he suggested some helpful tips without withholding information. This made me feel comfortable to opt for his services and had 100% trust in him and his abilities. I would look forward to each session, as it was fun and focused at the same time.

Having had a musculoskeletal condition for years, this club had provided me facilities that accommodated for my rehabilitation and recovery, by doing Reformer Pilates and Yoga. There are a lot of different classes to choose from throughout the day (morning to evening) with different instructors, ranging from beginner, intermediate, to advanced level reformer, and various types of yoga; align (hatha), flow (vinyasa), and calm (yin and restorative). Moreover, VA has a few branches that are located quite strategically. The classes are easily booked through the VA app.

Jessica is my favourite Yoga Instructor. I like the way she leads the class through the gentleness of her voice, how she gives instructions, and how she paces the shift from one posture to another. Though it may be a big class, she was able to observe, recognise, and correct the practitioners form and alignment (didnt inform her that I had the condition in the beginning, but she could tell). She was able to kindly tell not to force doing certain movements/postures, and to give alternatives to those who need it. All in all, most of the Pilates and Yoga instructors are great and have different strengths/ways on how they lead the classes, so one may book and access the classes according to their schedule, location and instructors preferences.",11 months ago,2024-01-17T14:50:23,"Hi Levina,

Gym floor: 3 stars
there has been no equipment upgrade all this while. It was rather embarrassing when my friends at cheaper gyms like Anytime Fitness and ActiveSG gyms have even basic equipments like rear delt flies / pec fly, hack squats, hip thrust machines and etc. I hope VA will step up to include more new machines. There are too many cardio machines that are not fully utilised so surely there's a better way to optimise the gym floor.

PT: 5 stars
I had the privilege of engaging Kah Wei for PT and his expertise, patience and knowledge is top-notched. He keeps himself updated with the latest science in power building, nutrition, hypertrophy, etc and even designed a program for me. I'm sure he has much more to offer when it comes to another client with different goals.

Kah Wei understood my fitness goals, lifestyle and needs and has always been patient in guiding me through and explaining the workouts. He even responded to my queries via text. You can't get a better trainer than this.

Yoga classes: 5 star
Lynne's expertise was evident as she guided us seamlessly through various yoga styles and poses. Lynne's clear communication made even the most complex poses feel accessible.

She exuded empathy, always attuned to our emotional and physical well-being, creating a supportive and nurturing atmosphere. Her encouragement was motivating, pushing us to explore our boundaries without any judgment.

Lynne's positive attitude was infectious. The sharing of yoga philosophy also integrated well into the class and serves as timely takeaways for us to bring back home and also to our office.",a year ago,2023-12-17T14:50:24,"Hi Hendrick,

This is despite the fact that the facilities and showers are much cleaner and newer at MO (more on this later).

I appreciate how Hayley goes above and beyond for her students (of varying levels of proficiency). She is proactive and professional, demonstrating and actively checking our postures. I've never seen her be late for class and she is amicable to both club members and those on Classpass. I love the playlists she personally curates for her lessons - I've saved it into my Spotify - as the music really sets the ambience for the yoga session. Classes are NEVER stopped short ahead of time and she is always happy to provide her advice and guidance whenever approached.

Being a rather tall person who's never had exposure to flexibility or mobility exercises, I was always stiff and could never bend over to touch the ground. It was only after I started practising yoga with Hayley - who was so accepting of the newbie me - that my flexibility improved. My fingers are now able to reach the ground. I know I'm still a WIP but I am forever grateful!

Would not have given anything short of 5 stars for Hayley but I'm deducting 1 star because the upkeep of VA Tanjong Pagar isn't really good. Toilet cubicles are often out of toilet paper. As for the shower cubicles, it's not uncommon that the shower gel/shampoo runs out, or that the water flow/pressure is less than ideal. I'm not trying to nitpick, but for a monthly membership fee ranging in the hundreds, I would expect a better quality.

Nevertheless, overall, I'm a pleased member and will continue to visit VA TP for my yoga classes with Hayley. Keep up the good work!",a year ago,2023-12-17T14:50:25,"Hi Pam,

being a gym owner in the past its very very tricky to please all clients and upkeep maintenance, the Annual maintenance costs , overheads of housekeeping supplies and rental is a lot of strain for this industry already and while customer experience is crucial in soo many aspects we also must have some compassion before complaining too much about the upkeep of facilities and lack of maintenance when clearly we are members can do our part by being respectful to how we use equipment .

Being mindful of our surroundings and having compassion is enough and free of cost that we can offer, the regular wear and tear of equipment will happen and be maintained.

I have never had a bad experience and maybe if we stick to the purpose a gym provides which is fitness and focus on improving our overall wellness then maybe we can progress beyond complaining.

Yes there is scope for improvement like the clothes provided , they are really weird in size and the color compared to the raffles and marina one branch but overall the experience is very pleasant and consistent performance from the team :-)

I visited the gym on a 1 time trial, the gym experience itself was good. So I signed up for a promo online that suits my needs. Once a week club visit for $30 dollars/ week ($30 dollar (is half price promo)/ week for 10 weeks with 12 weeks commitment period, means after the first 10 weeks, I will be paying $60dollar/week).

The supposed link for the specific terms before signing was not working at all (even until today and having counter check it with another browser type and another friend on their mobile/ pc). I made the mistake of assuming it is as straightforward as how it was marketed - one club visit a week. So I paid anyway and read through all the club rules and contract pdf that was sent as soon as I paid. It states nothing about how many classes i could go during the one club visit a week. The club rules pdf and website for class booking mylocker states 6 bookings at any give time and the contract does not indicate anything about class booking. At the end, through my own experience for a month I then realize it is 1 class booking = 1 club visit = 1 credit for each week.

The customer service team responds, but are mostly unaware of promotion details stating its a fairly new promotion or give wrong information which confuses you. At the end, they will just tell you theres nothing that can be done since youve already committed 12 weeks (after 10 weeks you will be charged $60dollar for 1 class booking in a week which is super expensive). The only option given is to appeal (depending on approval) for a change in membership type to contract even longer for unlimited club visit, but seeing their poor customer service I doubt they care very much about their individual members I decide to get this over and done with and return to Fitness First. Probably VA business model only cares about corporate membership which brings them bigger bucks.

Update 9th Nov 22: they actually change the site to specify its 1 club visit/ class per week now for a similar package i took (my friend was considering it so we went to check the site last 2 weeks). But they refuse to refund or even apologize for their mistake before.",2 years ago,2022-12-17T14:50:28,,,,14,102,302,1,,

His explanation of the PT offering is just misleading, and I ended up with more classes than I said I wanted. He had sold me a fixed number of classes, but in fact it was a perpetual subscription model. They have an auto-debiting system and simply continued debiting fees for PT fees. I found out too late that I had to initiate canceling the debiting otherwise they will carry on with it perpetually. There was no notice or reminder that the minimum commitment for classes had been met. I tried to obtain a refund for the excess classes after explaining, but didnt manage to.

While it feels really scammy, I wouldnt say it was blatant dishonesty, but I think their processes could be shaped up to prevent miscommunication. They also made little attempt to address my complaint and simply brushed it off, which I thought was extremely disappointing considering its a premium gym with premium fees. I would have continued being a member but they leave me no choice.

I have supported them since they opened in singapore 5 years ago. in Jan 2020, I signed up for a 2 year plan. paying 180/month for the convenience of going for classes, popping by the gym whenever my work allows me time for it. then covid happened and they froze my membership. Im now locked in till October 2022. however its a very different gym. classes are always booked, in fact it gets booked up the minute the time opens, I have to book a slot to use the gym. due to the nature of my work, I supported virgin because it was accessible all the time, now its accessible only if you book a few days in advance. essentially I can never use the gym.

I brought my concerns to the staff and they said there was nothing they can do. they they will check and come back- they never did, I thought that was poor customer service, especially a client for 5 years. Cancellation fee was 700. makes no sense to pay 700 to save 180*22months. I tried to appeal on the back of the fact that I am a repeat customer and if they let me off with 200 cancellation fee, the likelihood of me re-signing with them when covid restrictions ease is probably 99%. and I probably have to work for the next 20 years and intend to keep fit as well.

essentially, they are willing to earn my 3.9k for the next 22 months, than give me a 500 discount on the cancellation fee and potentially have me as a loyal customer back for perhaps the next 20 years- or about 43k assuming prices dont increase. in short, they are willing to save 500 to risk losing 43k.

perhaps times are bad and they need that 500 today. or the person I spoke with doesnt really care, or the club in general doesnt really care. either way, they did nothing wrong, I signed a contract so they are entitled to enforce it. I just thought the decision making wasnt very long sighted. pretty sure Richard Branson would be happy to lose 500 today then lose 43k over the next 20 years. then again why does he even care about 43k.

I am going to try and appeal again. I sincerely hope they can do something about this. but I want to urge the public to be very careful when you sign any deal with Virgin active. the facilities are great and so are the classes. but be mindful of the probability of getting those classes. they are very low. I used to go the Virgin 3 times a week, now with the restrictions its 1 time a month. my lifestyle has not changed, its just the booking process and circumstance.

if anyone is considering signing virgin, just be mindful of my story. thanks",3 years ago,2021-12-17T14:50:30,,,,15,10,4,,,

This used to be my favourite Virgin Active outlet, however the service level dropped significantly after lockdown. In addition to other peoples comments, it is unbelievable that the club has been short of face towels for a few months. I mean, how difficult it is to get new towel stock from Fairprice across the street?

Also, the restroom basin is the most inconvenient design ive ever seen. There is a huge mirror right in the middle of the basin, only about 20cm from your face, which rightfully blocks the faucets. It is impossible to wash face, or wash hands without bending ( to look for the faucet).

While there are multiple disinfect spray bottles around as safety measure, many of them are with spoilt spray head. No one ever checks when filling the bottles?

Have been a member for one month, and in love with the facility. Very convenient access to multiple outlets in CBD area, the member experience is good so far (noticed that they set guest pass price bar to control the crowd). One con is the Grid area (aka open training area) is often occupied by back to back group classes after 6pm. For people dont attend classes, many facilities like battle ropes, TRX cannot be used during the time period.",4 years ago,2020-12-17T14:50:30,,,,5,35,10,,,

Pros:
Firstly, there is no hard selling tactics used like other gyms in the neighborhood. They are transparent about their rates online, unlike other gyms that will give you a special price on immediate sign up type of offers.
They deliver what they charge for, the gyms are sparkling, class apart from most gyms. The vibrant ambience, the facilities, tons of equipment, healthy cafe, space and lots more makes anyone look forward to work out time.

Cons:
- For a location like tanjong pagar where there is residential crowds as well as office crowds, they could do with classes during the non-peak hours too. Classes were always too full at peak hour.
- At the end of my contract, I faced some challenges ...(I didnt end it because I didnt like the gym but I was relocating) and ofcourse there is always a one-off case but many businesses with membership contracts like gyms, phone companies have such issues, so no surprise there.

There's a pool shared with Sofitel, Himalayan salt inhalation room, sleeping pods for the busy executives wanting a quick nap, yoga studios, les mils classes (bodycombat, bodypump) and workout area with free weights. What I love is their threadmills machines come with Netflix (you need your own account) and YouTube!

Note this is not a written down policy (naturally as its rather unenforceable) just something they make up because they have to feel important for themselves.
