That unfortunately seems to be the case with many gyms in Singapore. With Fitness First whenever I showed any interest be it in person or on the website I got their sales people harassing me to take one of their memberships. They also advertise on their website a Fitpass with a fixed term access (1 week, 2 weeks, ...) without a commitment but in reality the messaging is gradually changed and by the time of the payment its a pass for 1, 2 ... classes within a 1, 2 ... week period.

As I already had travel plans and had no intentions to use the gym in Nov, I checked with the front desk staff if I could serve notice while my membership was on freeze. To which he said I could and proceeded to put my account on freeze for Nov.

Fast forward 1st December, I was notified that my card was charged the regular monthly fee for my supposedly terminated membership. Hence I called in (5 Dec) to the membership experience team and was attended by Rose, to which I learnt that there was no termination request put in as you cant have your account on freeze while on your notice period.

I explained that I had been wrongly informed of this since if I already had intentions to terminate my membership and I knew of this, how would putting my account on freeze make any sense at all? She then tells me shell investigate with the club and will get back to me in 2-3 business days.

My monthly payment is on auto payment/Giro on every 1st of the month. Never failed to make payment on time. I recently lost my wallet and had to replace my credit card and relink the auto payment. I arrived at the club on the 2 Oct, the staff informed me they did not manage to get my monthly payment on the 1 Oct from my lost credit card. I immediately paid the fee for Oct. And asked the staff to relink to my new credit card. She did and I gave her the OTP code to complete the transaction.

I was able to get to the gym subsequently (Tues, Wed)

On Thursday, I received an email from the office that they did not get my Oct payment and failed to deduct from my credit card. Hence my membership is suspended. I explained that I did make Oct payment and the new credit card was provided. She checked and confirmed they received the payment but I need to relink my credit card to reinstate my membership.

Why???? Oct payment was made and I should be able to link my credit card or choose to pay cash etc on a monthly basis. I should not be forced to link my credit card!

An hour later, another staff from ORQ club called me to inform me that my payment was not received....I repeated the whole story again.

I went to the club on Friday, and they in fact suspended my membership.

Till now, I have emailed the managers of the club and FF. No one is able to explain to me why they suspended my membership when I had made the payment.

I am not sure if the management has changed over the years.... everything from hygiene of the shower room to equipments are going down hill..... especially OGS club. And now they are behaving like cowboys....",a year ago,2023-12-17T14:44:47,,,,3,24,26,1,,

The price point is higher than average, but so is the service that you'll experience.

The gym is small, but it is not usually overcrowded during lunch, which leads to quicker workouts and showers. There's a lot of treadmill machines that are underused; most of the activity is concentrated in the free weights area.

The counter staff are always on hand to cater to your needs. One of them personally helped me search the gym and locker rooms when I misplaced my card. The women's locker rooms have also just been upgraded with quality rain showers.

The pool holds stunning views during sunset; whether you're soaking in the water, lounging on the reclining deck chairs or dozing off in the hammocks.
