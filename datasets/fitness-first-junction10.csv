This club does not provide with any attire. Only towels are given. So definitely over priced than other gyms.
Considering the limitation of space this club has, it is extremely crowded in the evening. The staff is rude. One day a staff member who was not even wearing Fitness first attire told me that he is a supervisor and started telling me about the fitness first policy. When I approached the front desk, they had no clue.. this guy followed me to the front desk and started arguing with me. I just left..
I am a member of FF since long time and I am regular patron on Metropolis gym.. never had such a rude experience.",10 months ago,2024-02-17T14:43:16,"Hi Vishal,


Thank you for your rating and feedback. I am sorry to hear that your gym experience was neither great nor positive. With regards to the no attire provided, just to share that J10, AMK and Tampines are premium clubs that doesnt provide any workout attires unlike the platinum clubs. Pertaining to the encounter that youve had with our fitness team leader, I believe that there might have been a misunderstanding. Based on this matter, I believe that a member was caught by our staff not adhering to our gym policies, whereby this particular member was using inappropriate footwear while on the treadmill. That is definitely against our safety policy and we have the right to inform a member accordingly on the clubs rules and guidelines. I am not sure if this is the incident that you are referring to. Nonetheless if it is, I would like to apologise for this unfortunate incident. I also acknowledge that our staff might not have been in uniform however, I must emphasise that its our duty to inform members immediately especially when it comes to a members safety on the gym floor. And i believe that the staff only has good intentions and hence the necessary call to action. If you have any other concerns, you can kindly approach myself over at the gym. Thank you once again for being a great supporter of Fitness First for the last few years.

Great service from staff, clean and well maintained facilities, wide range of equipment although slightly old, never too crowded. Nice gym crowd with varying levels of experience.

Only gripe is that it can get warm at times in the toilets and weightlifting area, due to the building structure that makes it hard to retain cold air (they do provide a big fan). Sometimes you may also smell the Sheng Shiong located beneath the gym, as they probably share the same vents.

Compound lifts equipment available:
1 flat bench press rack
1 incline bench press rack
1 half rack
1 full rack with attached platform
1 smith machine",2 years ago,2022-12-17T14:43:18,"Thank you Jayvinn for your 5 star rating and feedback. I am sorry to hear about the air-conditioning issues.

The sales manager who manages this Google page, is no better as he claimed that injuries would only occur after 48 hours with Danny so it could have been the group FF classes that I joined . Ok can. I only used 7 out of 8 PT sessions.

Left negative feedback on the FF junction 10 FB page and was blocked. Wow.

Highly recommend those who want to keep fit like me to join Fitness First Junction10.

All staffs at Junction10 are very friendly & helpful,
especially Aaron Tok, very professional & helpful in assisting any queries when approached. When I have doubt on the boditrax apps, Aaron made efforts to explain & guided me through.

And my personal trainer, Jake Tan, who is very patient & motivational when doing PT. Jake will modify the training to suit my age & fitness level. Even when I am not having PT session, when approach, Jake will explain how to use the various equipments in a very helpful way.
I have gained lots of confidence & able to train independently, largely due to the staffs friendliness & professionalism they perform.

ive seen some improvements since my first time here a year ago. they replaced all plates and bars for classes, provided more equipment etc. class size can be improved as i noticed that thursday evening classes are always extremely packed to the point where there is not enough space to maneuver.

the greatest disappointment will be my consultant, Joy (probably not from J10), who disappeared almost immediately after i signed up for the membership. needed help in suspension of the membership and texted her to no avail. i guess it is fair to say some consultants (not all) only exist when you have something to offer.",5 years ago,2019-12-17T14:43:24,,,,1,29,58,1,,

Though its not as full featured as other outlets, its not as bad as people put it out to be.

Cons:
- Attire isnt provided, only towels
- In terms of drinks only a water cooler is provided (I dont need fancy drinks but I prefer warm water)
- Sauna room doesnt get hot enough, dont think its the type where you can pour water over as well. Too bright!
- No steam room!
