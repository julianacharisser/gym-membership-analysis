First you have to meet a salesperson before theyll tell you the fees, and second you must pay an initiation fee which is the worst part of gym memberships.

The salesperson said to waive the initiation fee, I will have to sign up for personal training sessions and nutritional supplements. I chose that but the personal trainer assigned to me had a very bad attitude. I told him Id trained before (with my fiance) and he mocked my form. 2 years?

Very disappointed with yoga class by Albert Tan, he basically just used the opportunity to showcase his advance yoga skills
Its not a class to show what he can do it should be a class to teach how to do different poses but he ended up skipping the basic and demo the advance poses.
Another occasion one friday lunch time i was the only member for Christine Tan class and she just asked if I had anything that i need to concentrate on and showed me a few poses then winded up the class in 15 minutes. I did not go all the way to attend a 15 minutes class.
Good yoga instructors that i hope will continue teaching are Ian Fung, Faiz, Dawn Tan and a few more.",2 years ago,2022-12-17T14:47:32,,,,4,35,10,1,,

I was very scared at the time, I went to the bar to ask for help. It was 7:30 in the evening. I went to the bar to find a solution. The two beauties at the bar told me that all the people in charge were off work at that time. Then the reply to me was that there was no one, and the two of them gave me a smile that no one would care about if you complained. At this time, the fitness instructor with no trace of training came over again, stared at me, and pointed at me, as if to say If there is anything rude, it may be because many people are watching. The coach was very excited and made a  gesture towards me. Since he is not good at quarreling in crowded places, you win the customer, but you lose. The influence of the company, and many people nearby saw the performance of the fitness instructor. Will having such employees have a good impact on your company?

He checks on me every time to make sure I am ok before and after my session. 4 months on, I have made considerable progress which motivates me to train regularly at the gym.
The gym is spacious and well-equipped. It has a big locker room and lounge area on the second floor. The toilet and shower rooms are kept clean always. The equipments are clean and well-maintained. I do not join the classes and I am not pressured to sign up for any, which is good.

Compared to them, this has also the biggest resting lounge area. The toilet and lounge and dance studio is on the second level while the rest of the gym is on the first.

The many treadmills had window view and TVs of international channels. (Westgate only has a pool view but no TV. Changi Biz hub had tv but the view outside the window was nothing much, AMK hub is basement so they only had TV, Paya Lebar only has window view and 100AM has no TV)
