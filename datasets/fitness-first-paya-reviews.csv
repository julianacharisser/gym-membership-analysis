Just as expected, more than disappointing. Adding my negative review as a complement read to the others who negatively reviewed the gym environment and equipment (to which I wholeheartedly agree as well).

I wonder if FF staff are actually deliberately inattentive to those on (free) trials, because the experience I got was abysmal.

Counter staff was curt through and through. Is she stressed out or did FF hire any one willing to take up a job? Although I was new, no orientation was done, just flippant random finger pointing of where locations might be. Was passed the locker card which I did not know how to use and was not told how to. Had to wait for a random gym user to pass through the female toilet to ask her.

I was there to experience a group class. I specifically told the sales rep (Edmund) that I wanted to try Bodypump. Made no effort to help secure that class although he knew it was popular. Got the class after that, which was Bodybalance. Sales rep was also not there to facilitate the process.

Instructor did not bother to orientate or brief class participants about equipment setup, just assumed everyone would know or figure out, despite there being more than one newbie. Me, being a guest, did not know about this cryptic chope-ing rule of mats, 2 ladies complained about me to the instructor when I took one of their mats, and he did nothing to ameliorate the situation. I offered to switch but the butch-looking one told me to ""forget it"". What a horrid encounter before the class even started. Not only the staff, but the members were equally hostile.

Despite relating all these to the sales rep via WhatsApp, all he could do was to say sorry. No customer/service recovery whatsoever, even when I said I would not sign with FF. What a lazy sales rep.

Don't bother signing with FF. Don't think they even need more clients since the sales rep did nothing to try to secure a deal, and staff on-site did nothing to make the experience pleasant.

There are a ton of other places that offer Les Mills and better instructors. Don't waste your time here.

The personal training session with Jasper Chin was unprofessional--he was overly touchy. For example, during a lower back exercise, I did not do the exercise correctly and he slapped the area near my hip and laughed about it. I was shocked and uncomfortable with his behaviour. During another exercise, he made an inappropriate comment about my waist, saying that people with small waists would dote on their future partners. There were also times when he made dismissive comments, saying that some girls are overly sensitive--which felt like a form of gaslighting.

He also kept pushing the training package while insisting he wasnt earning a commission, and even sent photos of famous people, claiming he had trained them. His actions and comments made me feel extremely uncomfortable, and I did not pay a premium price for such unprofessional service!

As someone signing up for a personal trainer for the first time, I was not informed about my option to choose a trainer. The salesperson assigned me a trainer without asking for my preference, which further added to the unprofessionalism! I hope Fitness First Paya Lebar will make this option clear to all their clients, including whether they prefer a female or male trainer.

Additionally, personal trainers should maintain professionalism and avoid sending irrelevant content. It would have been more appropriate for the trainer to send a text to schedule/reschedule the PT session instead of making repeated phone calls, which I found unprofessional and intrusive...",a month ago,2024-11-13T01:31:58,,,,6,1,,,,

His tone attitude was not only pleasant, but also in a helpful customer oriented manner which I appreciated very much.

Although initially he could not understand what I meant by a ""VIP membership card"", he used his initiative to run through the generic cards from his drawer to help bridge a common understanding of what I was referring to.

He went on to verify my membership, when I was last issued with a physical card and the years I've been with Fitness First to qualify for the issuance of the card.

The few times I went to this outlet, the staff were not friendly - this, I wouldn't complain about on its own. But, what's frustrating is their attitude and service when I reported my lost card.

I went on 15 August and checked in in the morning. After my session, I reported that I lost my card and think I left it in the exercise shorts, which I placed in the laundry. The staff immediately said there is no lost card - if there were, they would've been alerted by the cleaner already. I said I JUST left the toilet 10min ago, so the cleaner may not have cleared the laundry since then. I told the staff I've to rush off but please call me in 2-3 hours to update me about the status of my card.

The staff gave assurance that whether or not they find it, they will call me to let me know. But on the same day, more than 2-3 hours later (**this would be around 5pm**), they still had not called me.

I called Paya Lebar outlet to check on the status of my card. They said they already took down my name and will call me if they find it. By the next day, they still had not called me.

I then called FF and someone on the line said they've reported my request directly to Paya Lebar's outlet and the staff will call me. Still, no call.

2 weeks have passed and I haven't received a call from the Paya Lebar staff. I went to a different outlet to ask for a check on my card. The staff at the other outlet told me there were TWO check-ins on my card at the Paya Lebar outlet on 15 August. **One was around 5.30pm** Meaning, either the staff found my card and checked-in for whatever reason, or someone else used my card at the same outlet and the staff just let the person in. Moreover, the staff did not inform me about this when I called them around 5+pm that same day, and instead told me my card still hasn't been found.

What were the Paya Lebar staff doing? They said they had taken down my name and card number and would be on alert... why did they not pick up on this and not call me the entire time? Either the staff are irresponsible, negligent, or dishonest?

The staff from the other outlet said he will inform Paya Lebar to call me. One day later, still no call.

The environment differs depending on the store, and I think the main features of PayaLebar are that it has a relatively large selection of weight machines compared to other FitnessFirst stores, has a boxing area, and is open even on Sundays.

For me, the advantage is that its located in a shopping mall in front of the station, that there are multiple shopping malls adjacent to it, and that its convenient for shopping and eating after returning from the gym.

Fitness First in the business district where I usually go is often closed on Sundays and public holidays, so I use it when I want to go on Sundays.
*You will need a special pass to visit any store.

There is no pool.
The shower is attached to the ceiling rather than the wall, which is a negative point for me as I like to wash my face and head separately.",2 years ago,2022-12-13T01:32:04,,,,0,404,1512,1,"Hui Yuan desu. Shi She moQi Li desu.

Referral staff was not around when I signed in which caused some confusion with receptionists about whether or not I could use my trial pass on the day, and almost got turned away.

Overall, staff didn't feel welcoming or friendly, and were quite pushy in terms of sales as well. The minute I said I'll think about it and listed my factors for consideration - crowds, space, equipment variety, location - she tried to guilt-trip me by saying I ""will not reaching my fitness goals by making excuses for myself"", although these are valid pointers for consideration? What a turn-off if you're trying to get someone to sign up for your gym!

Facilities wise, as others have pointed out, 75% of the area was used for group classes and it was very crowded. Equipment and machine range not as wide in variety as other gyms, even the smaller ones.

Have always just ignored the bad policies from the management but the most recent incident really annoyed me. I just switched my payment mode from credit card to giro. I was told it would take 4-6 weeks to activate and during the transition period, I would have to make a manual payment at the counter when I visit the gym. But on 2nd April I received a call from Geena Kaur asking for my CARD NUMBER and expiry date. I was shocked! I told her I was not comfortable in giving such details over the phone and as I was intending to head down to the gym later in the evening, I told her i would make payment at the counter. But she INSISTED I give it to her over the phone.

When you first sign up, they tell you that you can freeze your membership anytime and the fee can be pro-rated if you need to freeze it for less than a month. When I wanted to freeze my membership for the last 2 weeks of the month, I was told it could not be done. Reason given was that they can only freeze a minimum of a whole month starting from the beginning of the month and the pro-rating was if i cut the freeze before the month ended. Which means if I have to travel, i can only travel after the first week of the month if I want to get it freezed it or get it pro-rated which is absolutely ridiculous.

The counter staffs and trainers were all really nice and friendly, but the management and management staffs are really bad.",5 years ago,2019-12-13T01:32:08,,,,2,3,,,,

Resistance/free weights area is good, didn't notice an assisted pull-up/dip station or Smith machine. This Area will feel cramped when busy, but during off-peak times the proximity of the machines is actually quite convenient.

My only small gripes are the limited number of cable attachments. The classes are loud but I train with music and this doesn't bother me. Would be frustrating for someone wanting to use the bodyweight training areas whilst there are classes using them, suggest checking the class schedules before planning your training times.

Charging station around the refreshments area is very handy too.",6 years ago,2018-12-13T01:32:09,,,,0,9,,,,
