One of the most rewarding aspects has been fitting into clothes I thought Id never wear again, including my work uniform. Its an incredible feeling to see such tangible results and feel more confident every day.

Throughout our sessions, Khais been supportive, motivating, and incredibly knowledgeable. He makes every workout session enjoyable and challenging. If youre looking for someone who truly cares about your progress and will push you to be your best, I cant recommend Khai enough.

Had booked a class today at 10.45pm today but have forgotten to bring my wallet and thus my virgin active card.

I understand fully the company policy that card has to be brought for check-in but was hoping that I can use my Virgin Active app to indicate my Virgin Active membership and the class booking.

However, I am shocked to be met by hostile customer service from a male staff who seems pissed that I didnt bring my card and used an aggressive tone with me. I am alright with the message yes I should always bring my card but the tone used here is horrible. I explained kindly that this is a one-off instance and he just replied curtly asking what attire I need. I replied my sizing and requested a locker as well and he replied in a dismissive tone for a locker I will need to provide a card as a deposit. I explained once again that I have left my wallet at home and this is not able to provide my card. But l do have a confirmed class booking and cant the staff use my details (e.g writing on a note my membership ID and using that as a deposit ) if they are that concerned about me stealing a locker key?

I will not be stating the above if Virgin Active does not command a premium price for its gym membership.

I would like to compliment Jeslin and Lynne for their super great Yoga Flow and Align classes! Their passion for yoga is evident, and their teaching style is both supportive and inspiring. They create a warm and welcoming atmosphere that encourages personal growth and exploration on the mat.

Like the energy and positive vibes they bring to class each time (as we feel it in during the practice), and they bring great sequences too! A sequence consist of breakdown poses (to strengthen and lengthen), leading up to getting advanced poses seamlessly! There are very attentive to their class attendance such they always accessible or stronger poses for everyone; be it for Beginners to Advanced Practioners! Strong practice which might get Beginners intimidated but it is a great practice to attend to consistently - You just get stronger day-by-day! They give clear cues to enter and exit to poses - which is important to prevent injuries.

And their calm class is superrrr good. It brings back ones inner peace and focus after a long day! Thanks Jeslin and Lynne for being amazing always!

I must say it has been one of the best wellness decisions Ive made in a long time.

I decided to take up PT because I was seriously getting out of shape and yet had no idea how to begin at the gym. I had a previous lower back injury and also play football once a week - I wanted the gym training to accommodate to this whilst also being able to get the most out of it. The training program that Roy has planned for me has been very effective, and he is always making minor adjustments to ensure that the intensity and gains for each session are optimal. He is very knowledgeable and just about knows every kind of exercise or movement - which is very beneficial as he can still find an exercise to work a muscle even when it no longer has strength or is very pumped. He also doesnt try to push you to do or sacrifice things that you may be uncomfortable or not ready for the sake of progress. He is also a very encouraging and dedicated trainer - he even plans my workouts for me on days that I train alone, though he is not obliged to do so. I can see very visible progress in the short 4 months training under him - my arms have grown, I dropped 2 inches in waist size, I dropped 5% body fat, I can now dumbbell chest press 18kg now compared to 6kg when I started, honestly this list can go on. I highly recommend Roy to anyone who wants to get into shape but has no idea how to start or has never ever been to the gym before.

Also, my experience with the Paya Lebar outlet has been fantastic so far. You can really tell that a lot of effort has been put in by the staff to provide and maintain that premium feel, which makes going to the gym a more enjoyable and comfortable experience. Though this may be a more compact outlet compared to the other Virgin Active outlets in the CBD, honestly it has more than enough to cater to people with varying levels of fitness and interests. The gym is visited by both beginners and heavy lifters alike across all age groups and the classes are always fully booked. And by classes I mean reformer pilates, spin, bodypump and GRID training - yes all of these are available at Paya Lebar! I can see myself being a regular here for a very long time, and will strongly recommend everyone to give this gym a go if youre looking for a superb place to get a workout.",a year ago,2023-12-10T11:35:34,"Hey there,

Quality of Training:

I appreciate the simple pricing system that gives me access to all their clubs, the staff are always welcoming and friendly, and I like the clean and well-appointed changing rooms. I frequent the Paya Lebar outlet the most often as its the most convenient and while its smaller than the other clubs (which have expanded facilities like swimming pools and Himalayan salt rooms), its adequate for my needs. What I like best are the variety of classes on offer. Theres Pilates, yoga, spin, boxing, and more and heres hoping VA will consider expanding the number of popular classes like Reformer (Align) in the future so that members have a higher chance of booking a slot.

One minor gripe I have is that you have to log into the Virgin Active MyLocker website to book classes, which strikes me as strangely archaic as even many of the smaller studios and gyms in Singapore these days have dedicated apps that allow you to book classes quickly and easily. The website seems prone to lags and crashes, and while theres a function that allows you to watch classes that are full, youll need to once again log in to find out if a slot has opened up. This wouldnt be a problem if there was an app that could send members notifications about slot openings.

That being said, my overall experience with VA has been good so far and with some improvements made to the technology, more classes offered throughout the day (and maybe more outlets across the island in the future?), theres no reason why it wouldnt be able to set the gold standard when it comes to chain gym brands in Singapore.",a year ago,2023-12-10T11:35:35,"Thank you for sharing your detailed feedback about your experience with Virgin Active!

I believe I made it pretty clear the moment I stepped foot into VA that it's my first time and am new to the studio.

Checked in at the counter where staff gave weird looks and no one came forward to give me a quick tour of their facility and / or directives as to where I could purchase my grip socks. I was early (got in 11:10AM) and was left to navigate the studio on my own (while experiencing the demeaning looks from VA staff).

The Reformer Beginner class was conducted by someone they outsourced, she isn't a Pilates instructor w VA, just here to stand in for another instructor. OK. The class was mediocre at best, sped through without much application of techniques such as alignment, breathing etc which are obv core to Reformer Pilates.

I do not encourage anyone to waste any time doing a class with them.

I used to go to True and Anytime.

The personal touch of each outlets and the attention put in details are amazing. One great example is the machine to squeeze your wet clothes (have no idea what it is called), the toiletries available such as deodorant, body lotion and also amenities such as hair straightener (even for guys), iron board and the occasional partnership pop-up is such a great environment for all to enjoy.

Most importantly, the gym equipments are top notch and always serviced frequently so broken down machines are super rare. I havent mention, how thoughtfully each machines are arrange in a way that users dont really have to work far to go from one place to another.

When it comes to classes, I must say VAs classes are close to what private studios would offer. The quality of Yoga classes are on par if not better than half of Classpass studios. I will not compare with True because theirs is just a nightmare.

Last but not least, I just hope that they can maintain a healthy flow of gym goers as it can be quite crowded at peak hours or make my dream come true if they would open up a new outlet (maybe in Orchard since TEL line is now there).

I cant wait to go to other VAs around the globe and hope I can stay healthy with such a great environment to work out. I also hoped that the upper management can treat staff much better as Ive seen many left for better offers (quite sad to see some leave).
